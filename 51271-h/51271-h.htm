<span class="small">TO SECOND EDITION.</span></h2>
</div>

<p>Mackenzie’s <cite>History of the Highland Clearances</cite>,
with its thrilling and almost incredible narratives
of oppression and eviction, has been for a long time
out of print. In view of the current movement,
described by Mr. Asquith as an “organised campaign
against the present system of land tenure,” it has
occurred to the holder of the copyright, Mr. Eneas
Mackay, publisher, Stirling, that, at the present
juncture, a re-issue might be expediently prepared.
He recognised that the story of the great upheaval
which, early in the nineteenth century, took place
among the Highland crofters would be of undoubted
interest and utility to those who follow the efforts now
put forth to settle the land question in Scotland. At
his request I readily undertook the task of re-editing.</p>

<p>The circumstances, or points of view, having changed
in no slight measure since the first appearance of the
work, I decided to subject it to a pretty thorough
revision&mdash;to excise a large mass of irrelevant matter
and to introduce several fresh articles. Donald
Macleod’s “Gloomy Memories” are omitted out of
considerations for space, and because it is proposed to
reprint them shortly in a separate form. There is
included, for the first time, a vindication of the
Sutherland Clearances by Mrs. Harriet Beecher
Stowe, author of “Uncle Tom’s Cabin,” and another
by Mr. James Loch, principal factor on the Sutherland<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
Estates during the time the removals were carried
out. There are also given graphic and realistic word
pictures of these evictions by the Rev. Donald Sage.
The general arrangement of the book has been
altered to the extent of grouping together the accounts
relating to each particular county, and descriptions
are added of a number of Clearances which were not
dealt with in the first edition.</p>

<p>I have pleasure in acknowledging my indebtedness
to Mr. Ian Macpherson, M.P., and Dr. J. H.
Fullarton, London, for kindly looking over the proofs.</p>

<p>Special and very sincere thanks are due to Mr.
John Henderson, secretary of the National Library
Club, London, who manifested the kindest and
liveliest interest in the undertaking. Not only did
he read the proofs with scrupulous care, but he was
ever ready to give advice and offer suggestions when
cases of doubt arose. To me, one of the most
pleasant memories connected with the labour of
editing is the valuable assistance always so promptly
and cheerfully given by Mr. Henderson.</p>

<p>I greatly appreciate the courtesy shown by Messrs.
Daniel Ross &amp; Co., Ltd., publishers, Wick, in permitting
extracts to be taken from Mr. Sage’s
<cite lang="la" xml:lang="la">Memorabilia Domestica</cite>.</p>

<p>Regarding the Publisher, I may be permitted to
mention that he rendered my task very easy by
providing, sometimes at considerable trouble and
expense, all works of reference which I considered
would be of service in endeavouring to make this
History thoroughly accurate and reliable.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak"><a name="INTRODUCTION" id="INTRODUCTION"><i>INTRODUCTION.</i></a></h2>
</div>

<p>It is with great pleasure that I accede to the request
that I should write a short introduction to welcome this
reprint of so interesting and valuable a book as Mackenzie’s
<cite>Highland Clearances</cite>. It has long been out of
print, which anyone who recalls its first appearance will
easily understand. It was written by a Highlander who
commanded in a great measure the esteem of Highlanders,
and it collected for the first time the sane and
authenticated accounts of the experience of the
Highlanders in the great agrarian crisis of their
history. It appealed to the race as no book within recent
years has done. The Highlander loves his past and his
native land with a passionate attachment, and the story
of the great wrongs of the days of the clearances is still
deeply embedded in his mind. Within the last year or
two many accounts, more or less imaginary, have appeared
purporting to be true stories of those terrible days
in the north, and it is peculiarly appropriate that, when
once again men’s minds are centred on the great problem
of the land in this country as a whole, and specific attention
has been directed towards the Highlands, this
reprint should now appear. We are all, therefore, under
deep obligations to the public spirit and enterprize of the
publishers and others who have been good enough to
secure in an accessible form a reliable account of the
conditions and events which at once intensified the
acuteness of the land-hunger in the Highlands and constituted
the blackest page in Highland history.</p>

<p>Many evil deeds have been associated with the abuse
of the monopoly power of land ownership in this and
other countries, but it is safe to say that nowhere within
the limits of those islands, or, indeed, anywhere else at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
any time have blacker or more foul deeds been committed
in the sacred name of property than in the
Highlands of Scotland in those days. It has always been
a matter of astonishment that a brave race should ever
have submitted to them. This becomes all the more
remarkable, too, when one remembers that during those
very years regiments raised in these very districts of the
finest soldiers who ever marched to the stirring strains of
the bagpipes, were gaining for the empire and for British
arms the most noted achievements ever won in the
Napoleonic wars and in the colonies. It is true, of course,
and it is an eternal discredit, that many of these brave
fellows came back wounded and war-scarred to find, not
that a grateful country had taken care that the homes
and the helpless ones they had left behind were kept
sacred and immune from the greed and ruthless
savagery of the landlord or his hirelings, but that their
hearths and homes were desecrated and destroyed, and
every moral law of patriotism and honour had been
violated. “Their humble dwellings,” says Hugh Miller,
“were of their own rearing; it was they themselves who
had broken in their little fields from the waste; from time
immemorial, far beyond the reach of history, they had
possessed their mountain holdings, they had defended
them so well of old that the soil was still virgin ground,
in which the invader had found only a grave; and their
young men were now in foreign lands fighting at the command
of their chieftainess the battles of their country,
not in the character of hired soldiers, but of men who
regarded these very holdings as their stake in the
quarrel.” Well has my friend Mackenzie MacBride
expressed <span class="lock">it:&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
      <div class="verse">“Ye remnant of the brave!</div>
      <div class="verse">Who charge when the pipes are heard;</div>

      <div class="verse">’Tis but for the good of the land.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
      <div class="verse">And when the fight is done</div>
      <div class="verse">And you come back over the foam,</div>
      <div class="verse">‘Well done,’ they say, ‘you are good and true,</div>

</div><div class="stanza">
      <div class="verse">‘For the hill we want for the deer,</div>
      <div class="verse">And the glen the birds enjoy,</div>
      <div class="verse">And bad for the game is the smoke of the cot,</div>
      <div class="verse">And the song of the crofter’s boy.’”</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>The silence with which men of that calibre met these
hardships and cruelty might well remain an enigma to
one who does not know the Highlands. They knew that
for centuries their ancestors had tilled those lands and
lived free and untrammelled. By every moral law, if
not by the law of the land, they had a right to the soil
which had been defended with their own right arm and
that of their ancestors. These were the days when they
were useful to the chief, who assumed some indefinable
right to the land. But the day came after the “Forty-Five”
when men were no longer assets to the chief.
His territorial jurisdiction was broken. He wanted
money, not men, and the lonely silences of the hills
instead of merry laughter and prattle of children singing
graces by the wayside. And these men bore the change
which meant so much to them with patience. Why?
The Highlands were permeated then as now with a deep
religious sense. They lent a willing ear to the teachings
of the ministers of the Gospel, who wielded the power of
the iron hand which left its deep impress on the social life
and even the literature of the Highlands. They regarded
the minister as the stern oracle of truth, and the
strict interpreter of the meaning of the ways of God to
man. What happened was right. And a perusal of the
pages that are to follow will show what a mean use many
of these ministers made of the power which their faithful
flock believed was vested in them. These men were&mdash;with
a noble exception or two&mdash;in reality the servile tools
of the “estate” whose powers they feared, and whose
support they received. In their own interests and in
those of their earthly lord and master, they assured the
people that all their troubles were but part of the punishment
inflicted on them by Providence in the course of
working out their redemption! This attitude of the ministers
had another significance. In many parishes they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
were the only persons who were educated enough to write,
and so able to express the wrongs which their people
were called upon to endure. But their voices were silent
and their pens were idle, except, indeed, when they were
used to ennoble the character, the prestige, and the
benevolence of the evicting tyrant!</p>

<p>If they were thus comparatively passive in their
“white-washing,” there were others openly active. In
Hugh Miller’s words. “Ever since the planning of the
fatal experience which ruined Sutherland, the noble
family through which it was originated and carried on,
had betrayed the utmost jealousy in having its real result
made public. Volumes of special pleading have been
written on the subject. Pamphlets have been published,
laboured articles have been inserted in widely-spread
reviews&mdash;statistical accounts have been watched over
with the utmost surveillance. If the misrepresentations
of the press could have altered the matter of fact, famine
would not now be gnawing the vitals of Sutherland in a
year a little less abundant than its predecessors, nor would
the dejected and oppressed people be feeding their discontent
amid present misery, with the recollections of a
happier past. If a singularly well-conditioned and
wholesome district of country has been converted into one
wide ulcer of wretchedness and woe, it must be confessed
that the sore has been carefully bandaged up from the
public eye that if there has been little done for its cure,
there has at least been much done for its concealment.”
And then he goes on to say, “It has been said that the
Gaelic language removed a district more effectually from
the influence of English opinion than an ocean of three
thousand miles, and that the British public know better
what is doing in New York than what is doing in Lewis
or Skye.” And so the House of Sutherland inveigles
Mrs. Harriet Beecher Stowe, fresh from her literary
triumphs in the American environment of “Uncle Tom’s
Cabin,” with no knowledge of the Gaelic language which
“separated so effectually the district in which it was
spoken” from English public opinion, but in which language
alone grievances were likely to be expressed, to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
write a grovelling apology. This she does, forsooth, in
“Sunny Memories,” when the hearts and the spirits of
the people outside the circle in which she was receiving
well-merited, if short, hospitality were broken! Readers
of the “Clearances” will notice how completely Donald
M’Leod, whose name every lover of nobility of character,
courage, and justice will ever honour, demolishes her
insipid table-talk. An even worse type of white-washer
was James Loch, who is now put forward as an unbiassed
and disinterested observer of the gracious benevolence
and marvellous generosity of the House of Sutherland.
It was not mentioned that he was the factor for the then
Duke!</p>

<p>The most notorious of all the evictions were the Sutherlandshire
ones, and though there are many accounts
of them in this volume, the gruesomeness of which has
become a bye-word, they do not tell the whole tale.
Since this question was revived during these last few
months, I have had letters from descendants of the
evicted from all over the colonies with new and conclusive
proofs of the recklessness and severity which characterised
them. A factor visited a township in western Sutherland,
and went towards the house of the great grandmother
of one correspondent. He met her as she was
returning from milking the cows carrying a wooden
vessel of milk. Brutally he snatched it from her, and to
use his words, “drowned for ever the fire of her hearth
with it,” and then drove her and her children to search
through great privation for some foothold on rugged
ground beside the western sea. When this factor died,
his body was carried through another township. The
sympathy of the people was but slight, for they remembered
his cruelty. An old woman expressed the general,
but hitherto suppressed, feeling of the community when
she said, “<span lang="gd" xml:lang="gd">Cha deach am maor rìamh troimh na bhaile
cho samhach sa chaidh e an duigh</span>” (“The factor never
went through this township so peacefully as he went
to-day”).</p>

<p>If, as Hugh Miller says, there has been no lack of professional
white-washers, there has equally been no lack<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
of testimony, straight and true, from the hearts of the
people, in bitter lamentation over the cruelty that befel
the race at the hands of mercenary landlords. This testimony
does not come from one class nor from one county.
I have shown in another place how even Dr. Johnson,
who loved neither the Scots nor their traditions,
found himself “full of the old Highland spirit, and was
dissatisfied at hearing of rack rents and emigration,” and
was compelled to remark, “A rapacious chief would make
a wilderness of his estate;” how unprejudiced writers
like Mrs. Grant of Laggan bemoaned the rapacity of those
who drove away the descendants of men whom their
fathers led; and how bitterly a scholar like Professor
Blackie viewed the depopulated glens where once heroes
lived and fought. The bitterest note of all, as well as the
truest, is sung by the Gaelic bards. They were of the
people, and lived among them. They knew their feelings,
none better, and it was their right to express that feeling
with truth and with fearlessness in the language of the
people. And I know of no bard in any county in the
Highlands who has not vigorously denounced in some way
the cruelty to which his people were arbitrarily subjected.
It was a blow to them to find that chiefs of the old school
had departed, that a change&mdash;in Gaelic, change is the best
word for death&mdash;had taken place from the spirit of the
chief who said, “I would rather drink punch in the
house of my people than be enabled by their hardships to
drink claret in my own.” Well might a good Celt of a
later day have written of the new type of so-called chief:</p>

<p>Take the Islay bard. He seeks to arouse our indignation
because of glens and hillsides reft of men to
work and fight and of children who might sing to Nature
and her God. Clearly his patriotic soul is sorely bur<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>dened:
the cold iron that has entered into it has made his
soul terribly bitter. “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Facit indignatio versus.</span>” When
he looks around and thinks of the days that were, his
spirit is that of blood and carnage. He describes the
hills that he loves with wonderful grace of diction; he
hears a song or two&mdash;shieling songs&mdash;of marvellous
beauty, and “shieling songs contain many soft, siren
strains, which were believed to have their source in fairyland,”
for their airs came from the good folk of the hills.
But these things do not tempt him long; he is soon back
again to the point that was sorest of all to him&mdash;the
desolate glens and the hillsides “left to be garrisoned by
the lonely shepherd.” Some of the poets were sportsmen
like Duncan M’Intyre. Their grievance was always
against the sheep, and the lowland shepherds, who
desecrated for filthy lucre the hills which were their
birthright and who spoke an alien tongue which frightened
even the echoes!</p>

<p>Deer and sporting rights (after game laws were enacted)
soon became more profitable than sheep, and it is amusing
to find controversialists of to-day attempting to show that
evictions never took place on account of deer forests. It
was not the fault of the landlords that they did not.
Evictions took place for the object that was at the
moment most profitable. The Napoleonic wars made
sheep runs temporarily more profitable; but the moment
there was more profit to be obtained from sport and deer
forests, then deer forests were to a large extent substituted
for sheep runs. To-day there are over three million
acres in Northern Scotland alone devoted to these preserves;
and in 1892 the Deer Forest Commission scheduled
over one million seven hundred thousand acres as being
fit for small-holding purposes. The casual reader must
beware, and must notice that this vast number of acres
includes grazing lands also, otherwise critics who “avowedly
represent the landlord interests” may feel aggrieved.
But it will also be remembered that evictions primarily
took place for grazing purposes; and further, that a
small holding in Scotland is not quite the same as a small
holding in England. In England it consists of a number<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
of acres which are under cultivation; in Scotland, I am
referring, of course, to the deer forest country, it consists
of some acres of cultivated land with very often a very
large common outrun in moorland and hills for the township.
So that when the uninitiated see pictures of deer
forests that are said to be fit for small-holding purposes,
they will now understand and suppress a smile. If only
men could realise what can be produced out of what might
appear to be the most impossible places! It has been
said that if you give a man the secure possession of a
rock, he will turn it into a garden, and one has only got
to visit the Highlands to see how a hard-working and
industrious peasantry have sought in this way with success
to fight against the ills with which they were confronted
by an ungrateful landlordism. One of the worst
features of the “Clearances” was the method in which
they were perpetrated. Examples will be found in these
pages of sick people being carried out of their houses, and
left on the wayside when their houses were in flames, and
the present locations of some of the crofters are grim reminders
of the extreme privations suffered by the people
who settled in them. Perched on the rocks and moorlands,
these people were driven from the inland valleys,
and had to build themselves shelters from the turf and
stones of the hillside, and carve out of barren land with
enormous industry, and under the constant menace of
famine, the miserable patches of land which remain to-day
as evidence of their labours. The others were forced
to emigrate, and the sufferings of those who survived
well-nigh baffle description. The horrors of the small
emigrant sailing ships of these days, and particularly on
these occasions when people were packed together regardless
of comfort and the decencies of life, and without
sufficient food, were equalled only by the terrible privations
and struggle for existence that awaited those who
landed on the frozen lands of the north of Canada, to
be assailed by hostile Indians, the rigours of the weather,
and the desolation of an unfriendly country. It is altogether
a tale of barbarous action unequalled in the
annals of agrarian crime.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span></p>

<p>And need I do more than add what one who will
never be regarded other than as a typical Tory, has
written: “In too many instances the Highlands have been
drained, not of their superfluity of population, but of the
whole mass of the inhabitants, dispossessed by an unrelenting
avarice, which will one day be found to have been
as shortsighted as it is selfish and unjust. Meantime, the
Highlands may become the fairy ground for romance and
poetry, or the subject of experiment for the professors of
speculation, historical and economical. But, if the hour
of need should come, the pibroch may sound through the
deserted region, but the summons will remain unanswered.”
These are the words of Sir Walter Scott.</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">To</span> give a proper account of the Sutherland
Clearances would take a bulky volume. Indeed,
a large tome of 354 pages has been written
and published in their defence by him who was
mainly responsible for them, called “An
Account of the Sutherland Improvements,” by James
Loch, at that time Commissioner for the Marchioness of
Stafford and heiress of Sutherland. This was the first
account I ever read of these so-called improvements;
and it was quite enough to convince me, and it will be
sufficient to convince anyone who knows anything of the
country, that the improvement of the people, by driving
them in the most merciless and cruel manner from the
homes of their fathers, was carried out on a huge scale
and in the most inconsiderate and heartless manner by
those in charge of the Sutherland estates. But when
one reads the other side, Macleod’s “Gloomy Memories,”
General Stewart of Garth’s “Sketches of the Highlanders,”
and other contemporary publications, one
wonders that such iniquities could ever have been permitted
in any Christian country, much more so in Great
Britain, which has done so much for the amelioration
of subject races and the oppressed in every part of the
world, while her own brave sons have been persecuted,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
oppressed and banished without compensation by greedy
and cold-blooded proprietors, who owed their position
and their lands to the ancestors of the very men they were
now treating so cruelly.</p>

<p>The motives of the landlords, generally led by southern
factors worse than themselves, were, in most cases, pure
self-interest, and they pursued their policy of extermination
with a recklessness and remorselessness unparalleled
anywhere else where the Gospel of peace and charity was
preached&mdash;except, perhaps, unhappy Ireland. Generally,
law and justice, religion and humanity, were either
totally disregarded, or, what was worse, in many cases
converted into and applied as instruments of oppression.
Every conceivable means, short of the musket and the
sword, were used to drive the natives from the land they
loved, and to force them to exchange their crofts and
homes&mdash;brought originally into cultivation and built
by themselves, or by their forefathers&mdash;for wretched
patches among the barren rocks on the sea shore, and to
depend, after losing their cattle and their sheep, and after
having their houses burnt about their ears or razed to the
ground, on the uncertain produce of the sea for subsistence,
and that in the case of a people, who, in many
instances, and especially in Sutherlandshire, were totally
unacquainted with a seafaring life, and quite unfitted
to contend with its perils.</p>

<p>What was true generally of the Highlands, was in
the county of Sutherland carried to the greatest extreme.
That unfortunate county, according to an
eye-witness, was made another Moscow. The inhabitants
were literally burnt out, and every contrivance
and ingenious and unrelenting cruelty was eagerly
adopted for extirpating the race. Many lives were
sacrificed by famine and other hardships and privations;
hundreds, stripped of their all, emigrated to
the Canadas and other parts of America; great numbers,
especially of the young and athletic, sought employment
in the Lowlands and in England, where, few of them
being skilled workmen, they were obliged&mdash;even farmers
who had lived in comparative affluence in their own<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
country&mdash;to compete with common labourers, in communities
where their language and simple manners
rendered them objects of derision and ridicule. The aged
and infirm, the widows and orphans, with those of their
families who could not think of leaving them alone in
their helplessness, and a number, whose attachment
to the soil which contained the ashes of their ancestors,
were induced to accept of the wretched allotments
offered them on the wild moors and barren rocks. The
mild nature and religious training of the Highlanders
prevented a resort to that determined resistance and
revenge which has repeatedly set bounds to the rapacity
of landlords in Ireland. Their ignorance of the English
language, and the want of natural leaders, made it impossible
for them to make their grievances known to
the outside world. They were, therefore, maltreated
with impunity. The ministers generally sided with the
oppressing lairds, who had the Church patronage at their
disposal for themselves and for their sons. The professed
ministers of religion sanctioned the iniquity, “the foulest
deeds were glossed over, and all the evil which could not
be attributed to the natives themselves, such as severe
seasons, famines, and consequent disease, was by these
pious gentlemen ascribed to Providence, as a punishment
for sin.”</p>

<p>The system of turning out the ancient inhabitants
from their native soil throughout the Highlands during
the first half of the nineteenth century has been carried
into effect in the county of Sutherland with greater
severity and revolting cruelty than in any other part of
the Highlands, and that though the Countess-Marchioness
and her husband, the Marquis of Stafford, were by no
means devoid of humanity, however atrocious and devoid
of human feeling were the acts carried out in their name
by heartless underlings, who represented the ancient
tenantry to their superiors as lazy and rebellious, though,
they maintained, everything was being done for their
advantage and improvement. How this was done will
be seen in the sequel. South countrymen were introduced
and the land given to them for sheep farms over<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
the heads of the native tenantry. These strangers were
made justices of the peace and armed with all sorts of
authority in the county, and thus enabled to act in the
most harsh and tyrannical fashion, none making them
afraid; while the oppressed natives were placed completely
at their mercy. They dare not even complain,
for were not their oppressors also the administrators of
the law? The seventeen parish ministers, with the single
exception of the Rev. Mr. Sage, took the side of the powers
that were, exhorting the people to submit and to stifle
their cries of distress, telling them that all their sufferings
came from the hand of their Heavenly Father as a punishment
for their past transgressions. Most of these
ministers have since rendered their account, and let us
hope they have been forgiven for such cruel and blasphemous
conduct. But one cannot help noting, to what
horrid uses these men in Sutherlandshire and elsewhere
prostituted their sacred office and high calling.</p>

<p>The Sutherland clearances were commenced in a comparatively
mild way in 1807, by the ejection of ninety
families from Farr and Lairg. These were provided for
some fifteen or seventeen miles distant with smaller lots,
to which they were permitted to remove their cattle and
plenishing, leaving their crops unprotected, however,
in the ground from which they were evicted. They had
to pull down their old houses, remove the timber, and
build new ones, during which period they had in many
cases to sleep under the open canopy of heaven. In the
autumn they carried away, with great difficulty, what
remained of their crops, but the fatigue incurred cost a
few of them their lives, while others contracted diseases
which stuck to them during the remainder of their lives,
and shortened their days.</p>

<p>In 1809 several hundred were evicted from the parishes
of Dornoch, Rogart, Loth, Clyne, and Golspie, under
circumstances of much greater severity than those already
described. Several were driven by various means to
leave the country altogether, and to those who could not
be induced to do so, patches of moor and bog were offered
on Dornoch Moor and Brora Links&mdash;quite unfit for cul<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>tivation.
This process was carried on annually until,
in 1811, the land from which the people were ejected
was divided into large farms, and advertised as huge sheep
runs. The country was overrun with strangers who came
to look at these extensive tracts. Some of these gentlemen
got up a cry that they were afraid of their lives
among the evicted tenantry. A trumped-up story was
manufactured that one of the interlopers was pursued
by some of the natives of Kildonan, and put in bodily
fear. The military were sent for from Fort George.
The 21st Regiment was marched to Dunrobin Castle,
with artillery and cartloads of ammunition. A great
farce was performed; the people were sent for by the
factors to the Castle at a certain hour. They came
peaceably, but the farce must be gone through, the Riot
Act was read; a few sheepish, innocent Highlanders
were made prisoners, but nothing could be laid to their
charge, and they were almost immediately set at liberty,
while the soldiers were ordered back to Fort George.
The demonstration, however, had the desired effect in
cowing and frightening the people into the most absolute
submission. They became dismayed and broken-hearted,
and quietly submitted to their fate. The clergy
all this time were assiduous in preaching that all the
misfortunes of the people were “fore-ordained of God,
and denouncing the vengeance of Heaven and eternal
damnation on all those who would presume to make the
slightest resistance.” At the May term of 1812 large
districts of these parishes were cleared in the most peaceable
manner, the poor creatures foolishly believing the
false teaching of their selfish and dishonest spiritual
guides&mdash;save the mark! The Earl of Selkirk, who went
personally to the district, allured many of the evicted
people to emigrate to his estates on the Red River in
British North America, whither a whole ship-cargo of
them went. After a long and otherwise disastrous
passage they found themselves deceived and deserted
by the Earl, left to their unhappy fate in an inclement
wilderness, without any protection from the hordes of
Red Indian savages by whom the district was infested,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
and who plundered them of their all on their arrival
and finally massacred them, save a small remnant who
managed to escape, and travelled, through immense
difficulties, across trackless forests to Upper Canada.</p>

<p>The notorious Mr. Sellar was at this time sub-factor,
and in the spring of 1814 he took a large portion of the
parishes of Farr and Kildonan into his own hands. In
the month of March the old tenantry received notices
to quit at the ensuing May term, and a few days after the
summonses were served the greater portion of the heath
pasture was, by his orders, set on fire. By this cruel
proceeding the cattle belonging to the old tenantry were
left without food during the spring, and it was impossible
to dispose of them at a fair price, the price having fallen
after the war; for Napoleon was now a prisoner in Elba,
and the demand for cattle became temporarily dull, and
prices very much reduced. To make matters worse,
fodder was unusually scarce this spring, and the poor
people’s cattle depended for subsistence solely on the
spring grass which sprouts out among the heather, but
which this year had been burnt by the factor who would
himself reap the benefit when he came into possession
later on.</p>

<p>In May the work of ejectment was again commenced,
accompanied by cruelties hitherto unknown even in the
Highlands. Atrocities were perpetrated which I cannot
trust myself to describe in my own words. I shall give
what is much more valuable&mdash;a description by an eye-witness
in his own language. He says:&mdash;In former
removals the tenants had been allowed to carry away the
timber of their old dwellings to erect houses on their new
allotments, but now a more summary mode was adopted
by setting fire to them. The able-bodied men were by
this time away after their cattle or otherwise engaged
at a distance, so that the immediate sufferers by the
general house-burning that now commenced were the
aged and infirm, the women and children. As the lands
were now in the hands of the factor himself, and were to
be occupied as sheep farms, and as the people made no
resistance, they expected, at least, some indulgence in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
the way of permission to occupy their houses and other
buildings till they could gradually remove, and meanwhile
look after their growing crops. Their consternation
was therefore greater, when immediately after the
May term-day, a commencement was made to pull down
and set fire to the houses over their heads. The old
people, women and others, then began to preserve the
timber which was their own; but the devastators proceeded
with the greatest celerity, demolishing all before
them, and when they had overthrown all the houses in a
large tract of country they set fire to the wreck. Timber,
furniture, and every other article that could not be
instantly removed was consumed by fire or otherwise
utterly destroyed. The proceedings were carried on with
the greatest rapidity and the most reckless cruelty. The
cries of the victims, the confusion, the despair and horror
painted on the countenances of the one party, and the
exulting ferocity of the other, beggar all description.
At these scenes Mr. Sellar was present, and apparently,
as sworn by several witnesses at his subsequent trial,
ordering and directing the whole. Many deaths ensued
from alarm, from fatigue, and cold, the people having
been instantly deprived of shelter, and left to the mercies
of the elements. Some old men took to the woods and
to the rocks, wandering about in a state approaching
to, or of absolute, insanity; and several of them in this
situation lived only a few days. Pregnant women were
taken in premature labour, and several children did not
long survive their sufferings. “To these scenes,” says
Donald Macleod<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>, “I was an eye-witness, and am ready to
substantiate the truth of my statements, not only by my
own testimony, but by that of many others who were
present at the time. In such a scene of general devastation,
it is almost useless to particularise the cases of
individuals; the suffering was great and universal.
I shall, however, notice a very few of the extreme cases
of which I was myself an eye-witness. John Mackay’s
wife, Ravigill, in attempting to pull down her house, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
the absence of her husband, to preserve the timber, fell
through the roof. She was in consequence taken in
premature labour, and in that state was exposed to the
open air and to the view of all the by-standers. Donald
Munro, Garvott, lying in a fever, was turned out of his
house and exposed to the elements. Donald Macbeath,
an infirm and bed-ridden old man, had the house unroofed
over him, and was in that state exposed to the wind and
rain until death put a period to his sufferings. I was
present at the pulling down and burning of the house of
William Chisholm, Badinloskin, in which was lying his
wife’s mother, an old bed-ridden woman of nearly 100
years of age, none of the family being present. I informed
the persons about to set fire to the house of this
circumstance, and prevailed on them to wait until Mr.
Sellar came. On his arrival, I told him of the poor old
woman being in a condition unfit for removal, when he
replied, ‘Damn her, the old witch, she has lived too
long&mdash;let her burn.’ Fire was immediately set to the
house, and the blankets in which she was carried out were
in flames before she could be got out. She was placed in a
little shed, and it was with great difficulty they were prevented
from firing it also. The old woman’s daughter
arrived while the house was on fire, and assisted the neighbours
in removing her mother out of the flames and
smoke, presenting a picture of horror which I shall never
forget, but cannot attempt to describe.” Within five
days she was a corpse.</p>

<p>In 1816 Sellar was charged at Inverness, before the
Court of Justiciary, with culpable homicide and fire-raising
in connection with these proceedings, and, considering
all the circumstances, it is not at all surprising
that he was “honourably” acquitted of the grave charges
made against him. Almost immediately after, however,
he ceased to be factor on the Sutherland estates, and Mr.
Loch came into power. Evictions were carried out from
1814 down to 1819 and 1820, pretty much of the same
character as those already described, but the removal of
Mr. Young, the chief factor, and Mr. Sellar from power
was hailed with delight by the whole remaining popula<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>tion.
Their very names had become a terror. Their
appearance in any part of the county caused such alarm
as to make women fall into fits. One woman became so
terrified that she became insane, and whenever she saw
any one she did not recognise, she invariably cried out in a
state of absolute terror&mdash;“<i lang="gd" xml:lang="gd">Oh! sin Sellar</i>”&mdash;“Oh!
there’s Sellar.” The people, however, soon discovered
that the new factors were not much better. Several
leases which were current would not expire until 1819
and 1820, so that the evictions were necessarily only
partial from 1814 down to that period. The people
were reduced to such a state of poverty that even Mr.
Loch himself, in his “Sutherland Improvements,”
page 76, admits that&mdash;“Their wretchedness was so great
that, after pawning everything they possessed to the fishermen
on the coast, such as had no cattle were reduced to
come down from the hills in hundreds for the purpose
of gathering cockles on the shore. Those who lived
in the more remote situations of the county were obliged
to subsist upon broth made of nettles, thickened with a
little oatmeal. Those who had cattle had recourse to the
still more wretched expedient of bleeding them, and mixing
the blood with oatmeal, which they afterwards cut
into slices and fried. Those who had a little money
came down and slept all night upon the beach, in order to
watch the boats returning from the fishing, that they
might be in time to obtain a part of what had been
caught.” He, however, omitted to mention the share
he and his predecessors had taken in reducing the people
to such misery, and the fact that at this very time he had
constables stationed at the Little Ferry to prevent the
starved tenantry from collecting shellfish in the only place
where they could find them.</p>

<p>He prevailed upon the people to sign documents consenting
to remove at the next Whitsunday term, promising
at the same time to make good provision for them
elsewhere. In about a month after, the work of demolition
and devastation again commenced, and parts of the
parishes of Golspie, Rogart, Farr, and the whole of Kildonan
were in a blaze. Strong parties with faggots<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
and other combustible material were set to work; three
hundred houses were given ruthlessly to the flames, and
their occupants pushed out in the open air without food
or shelter. Macleod, who was present, describes the
horrible scene as <span class="lock">follows:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>“The consternation and confusion were extreme;
little or no time was given for the removal of persons
or property; the people striving to remove the sick and
the helpless before the fire should reach them; next,
struggling to save the most valuable of their effects. The
cries of the women and children, the roaring of the
affrighted cattle, hunted at the same time by the yelling
dogs of the shepherds amid the smoke and fire, altogether
presented a scene that completely baffles description&mdash;it
required to be seen to be believed. A dense cloud of
smoke enveloped the whole country by day, and even
extended far out to sea; at night an awfully grand but
terrific scene presented itself&mdash;all the houses in an extensive
district in flames at once. I myself ascended a
height about eleven o’clock in the evening, and counted
two hundred and fifty blazing houses, many of the
owners of which were my relations, and all of whom I
personally knew, but whose present condition&mdash;whether
in or out of the flames&mdash;I could not tell. The conflagration
lasted six days, till the whole of the dwellings were
reduced to ashes or smoking ruins. During one of these
days a boat actually lost her way in the dense smoke as
she approached the shore, but at night was enabled
to reach a landing-place by the lurid light of the
flames.”</p>

<p>The whole of the inhabitants of Kildonan, numbering
nearly 2000 souls, except three families, were utterly
rooted and burnt out, and the whole parish converted
into a solitary wilderness. The suffering was intense.
Some lost their reason. Over a hundred souls took
passage to Caithness in a small sloop, the master
humanely agreeing to take them in the hold, from which
he had just unloaded a cargo of quicklime. A head
storm came on, and they were nine days at sea in the most
miserable condition&mdash;men, women, and helpless chil<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>dren
huddled up together, with barely any provisions.
Several died in consequence, and others became invalids
for the rest of their days. One man, Donald Mackay,
whose family was suffering from a severe fever, carried
two of his children a distance of twenty-five miles to this
vessel. Another old man took shelter in a meal mill,
where he was kept from starvation by licking the meal
refuse scattered among the dust on the floor, and protected
from the rats and other vermin by his faithful
collie. George Munro, the miller at Farr, who had six
of his family down with fever, had to remove them in
that state to a damp kiln, while his home was given to the
flames. And all this was done in the name of proprietors
who could not be considered tyrants in the ordinary
sense of the term.</p>

<p>General Stewart of Garth, about a year after the
cruelties perpetrated in Sutherland, writes with regret
of the unnatural proceedings as “the delusions practised
(by his subordinates) on a generous and public-spirited
proprietor, which have been so perseveringly applied,
that it would appear as if all feeling of former kindness
towards the native tenantry had ceased to exist. To
them any uncultivated spot of moorland, however small,
was considered sufficient for the support of a family;
while the most lavish encouragement has been given to
all the new tenants, on whom, with the erection of buildings,
the improvement of lands, roads, bridges, &amp;c.,
upwards of £210,000 had been expended since 1808
(in fourteen years). With this proof of unprecedented
liberality, it cannot be sufficiently lamented that an estimate
of the character of these poor people was taken
from the misrepresentation of interested persons, instead
of judging from the conduct of the same men when
brought into the world, where they obtained a name and
character which have secured the esteem and approbation
of men high in honour and rank, and, from their talents
and experience, perfectly capable of judging with correctness.
With such proofs of capability, and with such
materials for carrying on the improvements and maintaining
the permanent prosperity of the county, when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
occupied by a hardy, abstemious race, easily led on to a
full exertion of their faculties by a proper management,
there cannot be a question but that if, instead of placing
them, as has been done, in situations bearing too near a
resemblance to the potato-gardens of Ireland, they had
been permitted to remain as cultivators of the soil,
receiving a moderate share of the vast sums lavished on
their richer successors, such a humane and considerate
regard to the prosperity of a whole people would undoubtedly
have answered every good purpose.” He
then goes on to show that when the valleys and higher
grounds were let to the sheep-farmers, the whole native
population was driven to the sea shore, where they
were crowded on small lots of land to earn subsistence by
labour and sea-fishing, the latter so little congenial to
their former habits and experience. “And these <em>one
or two acre lots</em> are represented as <em>improvements!</em>” He
then asks how in a country, without regular employment
or manufactories, a family is to be supported on one or
two acres? The thing was impossible, and the consequence
is that “over the whole of this district, where the
sea-shore is accessible, the coast is thickly studded with
thatched cottages, crowded with starving inhabitants,”
while strangers, with capital, usurp the land and
dispossess the swain. Ancient respectable tenants, who
passed the greater part of their lives in the enjoyment
of abundance, and in the exercise of hospitality and
charity, possessing stocks of ten, twenty, and thirty
breeding cows, with the usual proportion of other stock,
are now pining on one or two acres of bad land, with one
or two starved cows; and for this accommodation a
calculation is made, that they must support their families,
and pay the rents of their lots, not from the produce,
but from the sea. When the herring fishery succeeds,
they generally satisfy the landlords, whatever privations
they may suffer; but when the fishing fails, they fall in
arrears and are sequestrated and their stocks sold to pay
the rents, their lots given to others, and they and their
families turned adrift on the world; but in these trying
circumstances, he concludes, “we cannot sufficiently<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
admire their meek and patient spirit, supported by the
powerful influence of moral and religious principle.”</p>

<p>The beautiful Strathnaver, containing a population
equal to Kildonan, had been cleared in the same heartless
manner.</p>

<p>In 1828, Donald Macleod, after a considerable absence,
returned to his native Kildonan, where he attended divine
service in the parish church, which he found attended by a
congregation consisting of eight shepherds and their dogs&mdash;numbering
between twenty and thirty&mdash;the minister,
and three members of his family. Macleod came in too
late for the first psalm, but at the conclusion of the service
the fine old tune Bangor was given out, “when the four-footed
hearers became excited, got up on the seats, and
raised a most infernal chorus of howling. Their masters
attacked them with their crooks, which only made
matters worse; the yelping and howling continued to
the end of the service.” And Donald Macleod retired
to contemplate the painful and shameful scene, and contrast
it with what he had previously experienced as a
member, for many years, of the large and devout congregation
that worshipped formerly in the parish church of
his native valley.</p>

<p>The Parish Church of Farr was no longer in existence;
the fine population of Strathnaver was rooted and burnt
out during the general conflagration, and presented a
similar aspect to his own native parish. The church, no
longer found necessary, was razed to the ground, and its
timbers conveyed to construct one of the Sutherland
“improvements”&mdash;the Inn at Altnaharra, while the
minister’s house was converted into a dwelling for a fox-hunter.
A woman, well-known in the parish, travelling
through the desolated Strath next year after the evictions,
was asked on her return home for her news, when she
replied&mdash;“<span lang="gd" xml:lang="gd">O, chan eil ach sgiala bronach! sgiala
bronach!</span>” “Oh, only sad news, sad news! I have
seen the timber of our well attended kirk covering the
inn at Altnaharra; I have seen the kirk-yard where our
friends are mouldering filled with tarry sheep, and Mr.
Sage’s study turned into a kennel for Robert Gunn’s dogs,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
and I have seen a crow’s nest in James Gordon’s chimney
head;” after which she fell into a paroxysm of grief.</p>

<h3>THE REV. DONALD SAGE ON THE
SUTHERLAND CLEARANCES.</h3>

<p>I remained for about a year in the capacity of tutor in
the family of Mr. Robert MacKid, Sheriff-Substitute of
Sutherland, who lived at Kirkton, in the parish of Golspie.
I shall briefly sum up what I remember of this period.</p>

<p>It was a very short time previous to my residence in
Mr. MacKid’s family that the first “Sutherland Clearance”
took place. This consisted in the ejection from
their minutely-divided farms of several hundreds of the
Sutherlandshire aborigines, who had from time immemorial
been in possession of their mountain tenements.
This sweeping desolation extended over many parishes,
but it fell most heavily on the parish of Kildonan. It
was the device of one William Young, a successful corn-dealer
and land-improver. He rose from indigence, but
was naturally a man of taste, of an ingenious turn of
mind, and a shrewd calculator. After realising some
hundreds of pounds by corn-dealing, he purchased from
Sir Archibald Dunbar of Thundertown a small and valueless
property in Morayshire called Inverugie. It lay
upon the sea-shore, and, like many properties of more
ancient date, it had been completely covered with sea-sand
which had drifted upon its surface. For this small
and worthless spot he paid a correspondingly small
price&mdash;about £700&mdash;but, tasking his native and vigorous
genius for improvement, he set himself at once to better
his bargain. Making use of a plough of peculiar construction,
he turned the sand down and the rich old soil
up, and thus made it one of the most productive properties
in the county. This, with other necessary improvements,
however, involved him in debt; but, just as
it became a question with him how to pay it, his praise
in the north as a scientific improver of land reached
the ears of the Stafford family, who, in connection with
their immense wealth, were racked with the anxiety<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
to improve their Highland estate. As William Young
had been so successful on the estate of Inverugie they
thought he could not but be equally so on the Sutherland
estate. Young introduced the depopulating system into
Sutherland.<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> This system, during his tenure of office as
commissioner on the Sutherland property, was just at its
commencement. It was first brought to bear on the
parish of Kildonan. The whole north and south sides
of the Strath, from Kildonan to Caen on the left bank of
the river, and from Dalcharn to Marrel on the right
bank, were, at one fell sweep, cleared of their inhabitants.
The measures for their ejectment had been taken with
such promptness, and were so suddenly and brutally
carried out, as to excite a tumult among the people.
Young had as his associate in the factorship a man of
the name of Sellar, who acted in the subordinate capacity
of legal agent and accountant on the estate, and who,
by his unprincipled recklessness in conducting the process
of ejectment, added fuel to the flame. It was said that
the people rose almost <i>en masse</i>, that the constables
and officials were resisted and their lives threatened, and
the combination among the peasantry was represented
as assuming at last so alarming an aspect that the Sheriff-Depute
of the county was under the necessity of calling
in the military to quell the riot. A detachment of soldiers
was accordingly sent from Fort-George, a powder magazine
was erected at Dornoch, and every preparation made
as for the commencement of a civil war. But the chief
magistrate of the county, shrewdly suspecting the origin
of these reports, ordered back the military, came himself
alone among the people, and instituted a cool and impartial
enquiry into their proceedings. The result was
that the formidable riot, which was reported to have for
its objects the murder of Young and Sellar, the expulsion
of the store-farmers, and the burning of Dunrobin Castle,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
amounted after all only to this, that a certain number of
the people had congregated in different places and had
given vent to their outraged feelings and sense of oppression
in rash and unguarded terms. It could not be
proved that a single act of violence was committed. Sellar
laboured hard to involve my father and mother in the
criminality of these proceedings, but he utterly failed.
The peasantry, as fine as any in the world, were treated
by the owners of the soil as “good for nothing but to be
cast out and trodden under feet of men,” while the tract
of country thus depopulated was divided into two large
sheep farms, one of which was given in lease to William
Cluness of Cracaig, and the other to a Mr. Reid from
Northumberland.</p>

<p>The reckless lordly proprietors had resolved upon
the expulsion of their long-standing and much-attached
tenantry from their widely-extended estates, and the
Sutherland Clearance of 1819 was not only the climax
of their system of oppression for many years before, but
the extinction of the last remnant of the ancient Highland
peasantry in the north. As violent tempests send out
before them many a deep and sullen roar, so did the advancing
storm give notice of its approach by various
single acts of oppression. I can yet recall to memory
the deep and thrilling sensation which I experienced,
as I sat at the fireside in my rude, little parlour at
Achness, when the tidings of the meditated removal of
my poor flock first reached me from headquarters. It
might be about the beginning of October, 1818. A
tenant from the middle of the Strath had been to Rhives,
the residence of Mr. Young, the commissioner, paying his
rent. He was informed, and authorised to tell his
neighbours, that the rent for the half-year, ending in May,
1819, would not be demanded, as it was determined to
lay the districts of Strathnaver and Upper Kildonan
under sheep. This intelligence when first announced
was indignantly discredited by the people. Notwithstanding
their knowledge of former clearances they
clung to the hope that the “<span lang="gd" xml:lang="gd">Ban-mhorair Chataibh</span>”
(the Duchess of Sutherland) would not give her con<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>sent
to the warning as issued by her subordinates,
and thus deprive herself of her people, as truly a
part of her noble inheritance as were her broad acres.
But the course of a few weeks soon undeceived them.
Summonses of ejectment were issued and despatched all
over the district. These must have amounted to upwards
of a thousand, as the population of the Mission alone
was 1600 souls, and many more than those of the Mission
were ejected. The summonses were distributed with the
utmost preciseness. They were handed in at every
house and hovel alike, be the occupiers of them who or
what they might&mdash;minister, catechist, or elder, tenant,
or sub-tenant, out-servant, or cottar&mdash;all were made
to feel the irresponsible power of the proprietor. The
enormous amount of citations might also be accounted
for by the fact that Mr. Peter Sellar had a threefold
personal interest in the whole matter. He was, in the
first place, factor on the Sutherland estate at the time;
then, he was law agent for the proprietors; and, lastly,
the lessee or tacksman of more than a third of the county
to be cleared of its inhabitants. It may easily be conceived
how such a three-plied cord of worldly interest
would bind him over to greater rigour, and even atrocity,
in executing the orders of his superiors on the wretched
people among whom he was thus let loose like a beast of
prey. But the effects produced by these decided measures
I now distinctly remember. Having myself, in
common with the rest of my people, received one of these
notices, I resolved that, at the ensuing term of Martinmas,
I would remove from Achness, and go once more
permanently to reside under my father’s roof, although I
would at the same time continue the punctual discharge
of my pastoral duties among the people till they also
should be removed. I could not but regard the summoning
of the minister as tantamount to the putting down of
the ministration of the Word and ordinances of religion
in that part of the country. And, indeed, it is a fact, that,
although this desolate district is still occupied by shepherds,
no provision has, since that time, been made
for their spiritual wants. I left Achness, therefore, about<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
the middle of November, 1818, sold my cow at the Ardgay
market, and got my furniture conveyed to Kildonan
by my father’s horses and my own. The people received
the legal warning to leave for ever the homes of their
fathers with a sort of stupor&mdash;that apparent indifference
which is often the external aspect of intense feeling. As
they began, however, to awaken from the stunning
effects of this first intimation, their feelings found vent,
and I was much struck with the different ways in which
they expressed their sentiments. The truly pious
acknowledged the mighty hand of God in the matter.
In their prayers and religious conferences not a solitary
expression could be heard indicative of anger or vindictiveness,
but in the sight of God they humbled themselves,
and received the chastisement at His hand.
Those, however, who were strangers to such exalted and
ennobling impressions of the Gospel breathed deep and
muttered curses on the heads of the persons who subjected
them to such treatment. The more reckless portion
of them fully realised the character of the
impenitent in all ages, and indulged in the most culpable
excesses, even while this divine punishment was still
suspended over them. These last, however, were very
few in number&mdash;not more than a dozen. To my poor
and defenceless flock the dark hour of trial came at last
in right earnest. It was in the month of April, and about
the middle of it, that they were all&mdash;man, woman, and
child&mdash;from the heights of Farr to the mouth of the Naver,
on one day, to quit their tenements and go&mdash;many of
them knew not whither. For a few, some miserable
patches of ground along the shores were doled out as
lots, without aught in the shape of the poorest hut to
shelter them. Upon these lots it was intended that they
should build houses at their own expense, and cultivate
the ground, at the same time occupying themselves as
fishermen, although the great majority of them had never
set foot on a boat in their lives. Thither, therefore, they
were driven at a week’s warning. As for the rest most
of them knew not whither to go, unless their neighbours
on the shore provided them with a temporary shelter;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
for, on the day of their removal, they would not be allowed
to remain, even on the bleakest moor, and in the
open air, for a distance of twenty miles around.</p>

<p>On the Sabbath, a fortnight previous to the fated day,
I preached my valedictory sermon in Achness, and the
Sabbath thereafter at Ach-na-h-uaigh. Both occasions
were felt by myself and by the people from the oldest to the
youngest, to be among the bitterest and most overwhelming
experiences of our lives. In Strathnaver we assembled,
for the last time, at the place of Langdale, where I
had frequently preached before, on a beautiful green
sward overhung by Robert Gordon’s antique, romantic
little cottage on an eminence close beside us. The still-flowing
waters of the Naver swept past us a few yards to
the eastward. The Sabbath morning was unusually
fine, and mountain, hill, and dale, water and woodland,
among which we had so long dwelt, and with which all
our associations of “home” and “native land” were
so fondly linked, appeared to unite their attractions
to bid us farewell. My preparations for the pulpit had
always cost me much anxiety, but in view of this sore
scene of parting, they caused me pain almost beyond
endurance. I selected a text which had a pointed
reference to the peculiarity of our circumstances, but my
difficulty was how to restrain my feelings till I should
illustrate and enforce the great truths which it involved
with reference to eternity. The service began. The
very aspect of the congregation was of itself a sermon,
and a most impressive one. Old Achoul sat right opposite
to me. As my eye fell upon his venerable countenance,
bearing the impress of eighty-seven winters, I was
deeply affected, and could scarcely articulate the psalm.
I preached and the people listened, but every sentence
uttered and heard was in opposition to the tide of our
natural feelings, which, setting in against us, mounted
at every step of our progress higher and higher. At last
all restraints were compelled to give way. The preacher
ceased to speak, the people to listen. All lifted up their
voices, and wept, mingling their tears together. It was
indeed the place of parting, and the hour. The greater<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
number parted never again to behold each other in the
land of the living. My adieu to the people of Ach-na-h-uaighe
was scarcely less affecting, although somewhat
alleviated by the consideration that I had the prospect
of ministering still to those among them who had leases
of their farms, and whom Mr. Sellar, the factor and law
agent, had no power to remove.</p>

<p>The middle of the week brought on the day of the
Strathnaver Clearance (1819). It was a Tuesday. At
an early hour of that day Mr. Sellar, accompanied by the
Fiscal, and escorted by a strong body of constables,
sheriff-officers and others, commenced work at Grummore,
the first inhabited township to the west of the
Achness district. Their plan of operations was to clear
the cottages of their inmates, giving them about half-an-hour
to pack up and carry off their furniture, and then
set the cottages on fire. To this plan they ruthlessly
adhered, without the slightest regard to any obstacle
that might arise while carrying it into execution.</p>

<p>At Grumbeg lived a soldier’s widow, Henny Munro.
She had followed her husband in all his campaigns,
marches, and battles, in Sicily and in Spain. Whether
his death was on the field of battle, or the result of fever
or fatigue, I forget; but his faithful helpmeet attended
him to his last hour, and, when his spirit fled, closed his
eyes, and followed his remains to their last resting-place.
After his death she returned to Grumbeg, the place of
her nativity, and, as she was utterly destitute of any
means of support, she was affectionately received by her
friends, who built her a small cottage and gave her a cow
and grass for it. The din of arms, orders, and counter-orders
from headquarters, marchings and counter-marchings
and pitched battles, retreats and advances,
were the leading and nearly unceasing subjects of her
winter evening conversations. She was a joyous, cheery
old creature; so inoffensive, moreover, and so contented,
and brimful of good-will that all who got acquainted with
old Henny Munro could only desire to do her a good turn,
were it merely for the warm and hearty expressions of
gratitude with which it was received. Surely the factor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
and his followers did not personally know old Henny, or
they could not have treated her as they did. After the
cottages at Grummore were emptied of their inmates, and
roofs and rafters had been lighted up into one red blaze,
Mr. Sellar and his iron-hearted attendants approached
the residence of the soldier’s widow. Henny stood up
to plead for her furniture&mdash;the coarsest and most valueless
that well could be, but still her earthly all. She first
asked that, as her neighbours were so occupied with their
own furniture, hers might be allowed to remain till
they should be free to remove it for her. This request
was curtly refused. She then besought them to allow a
shepherd who was present and offered his services for
that purpose, to remove the furniture to his own residence
on the opposite shore of the loch, to remain there
till she could carry it away. This also was refused, and
she was told, with an oath, that if she did not take her
trumpery off within half-an-hour it would be burned.
The poor widow had only to task the remains of her bodily
strength, and address herself to the work of dragging
her chests, beds, presses, and stools out at the door, and
placing them at the gable of her cottage. No sooner was
her task accomplished than the torch was applied, the
widow’s hut, built of very combustible material, speedily
ignited, and there rose up rapidly, first a dense cloud of
smoke, and soon thereafter a bright red flame. The
wind unfortunately blew in the direction of the furniture,
and the flame, lighting upon it, speedily reduced it to
ashes.</p>

<p>In their progress down the Strath, Ceann-na-coille
was the next township reached by the fire-raising evictors.
An aged widow lived there who, by infirmity, had been
reduced to such a state of bodily weakness that she could
neither walk nor lie in bed. She could only, night and
day, sit in her chair; and having been confined for many
years in that posture, her limbs had become so stiff that
any attempt to move her was attended with acute pain.
She was the mother-in-law of Samuel Matheson, and had,
with her family, been removed by Mr. Sellar from
Rhimisdale some time before. His treatment of her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
and others on that occasion had brought Mr. Sellar
into trouble, but now, in the Providence of God, she
was once more in his power. “<span lang="gd" xml:lang="gd">Bean Raomasdail</span>,” or
“the good wife of Rhimisdale,” as she was called, was
much revered. In her house I have held diets of catechising
and meetings for prayer, and been signally refreshed
by her Christian converse. When the evicting
party commenced their operations in her township, the
aged widow’s house was among the very first that was
to be consigned to the flames. Her family and neighbours
represented the widow’s strong claims on their compassion,
and the imminent danger to her life of removing
her to such a distance as the lower end of the Strath, at
least ten miles off, without suitable means of conveyance.
They implored that she might be allowed to remain for
only two days till a conveyance could be provided for
her. They were told that they should have thought on
that before, and that she must immediately be removed
by her friends, or the constables would be ordered to do
it. The good wife of Rhimisdale was, therefore, raised
by her weeping family, from her chair and laid on a blanket,
the corners of which were held up by four of the
strongest youths in the place. All this she bore with
meekness, and while the eyes of her attendants were
streaming with tears, her pale and gentle countenance
was suffused with a smile. The change of posture and the
rapid motion of the bearers, however, awakened the most
intense pain, and her cries never ceased till within a
few miles of her destination, when she fell asleep. A burning
fever supervened, of which she died a few months
later.</p>

<p>During these proceedings, I was resident at my father’s
house, but I had occasion on the week immediately
ensuing to visit the manse of Tongue. On my way
thither, I passed through the scene of the campaign of
burning. The spectacle presented was hideous and
ghastly! The banks of the lake and the river, formerly
studded with cottages, now met the eye as a scene of
desolation. Of all the houses, the thatched roofs were
gone, but the walls, built of alternate layers of turf and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
stone, remained. The flames of the preceding week
still slumbered in their ruins, and sent up into the air
spiral columns of smoke; whilst here a gable, and there a
long side-wall, undermined by the fire burning within
them, might be seen tumbling to the ground, from which a
cloud of smoke, and then a dusky flame, slowly sprang
up. The sooty rafters of the cottages, as they were being
consumed, filled the air with a heavy and most offensive
odour. In short, nothing could more vividly represent
the horrors of grinding oppression, and the extent to
which one man, dressed up in a “little brief authority,”
will exercise that power, without feeling or restraint, to
the injury of his fellow-creatures.</p>

<h3>GENERAL STEWART OF GARTH ON THE
SUTHERLAND CLEARANCES.<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></h3>

<p>On the part of those who instituted similar improvements,
in which so few of the people were to have a share,
conciliatory measures, and a degree of tenderness, beyond
what would have been shown to strangers, were to have
been expected towards the hereditary supporters of their
families. It was, however, unfortunately the natural
consequences of the measures which were adopted, that
few men of liberal feelings could be induced to undertake
their execution. The respectable gentlemen, who, in
so many cases, had formerly been entrusted with the
management of Highland property, resigned, and their
places were supplied by persons cast in a coarser mould,
and, generally, strangers to the country, who, detesting
the people, and ignorant of their character, capability,
and language, quickly surmounted every obstacle, and
hurried on the change, without reflecting on the distress
of which it might be productive, or allowing the kindlier
feelings of landlords to operate in favour of their ancient
tenantry. To attempt a new system, and become
acceptable tenants, required a little time and a little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
indulgence, two things which it was resolved should not
be conceded them: they were immediately removed from
the fertile and cultivated farms; some left the country,
and others were offered limited portions of land on uncultivated
moors, on which they were to form a settlement;
and thus, while particular districts have been
desolated, the gross numerical population has, in some
manner, been preserved. Many judicious men, however,
doubt the policy of these measures, and dread their consequences
on the condition and habits of the people.
The following account of their situation is from the respectable
and intelligent clergyman of an extensive
parish in the <span class="lock">county:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>“When the valleys and higher grounds were let to the
shepherds, the whole population was drawn down to
the sea-shore, where they were crowded on small lots of
land, to earn their subsistence by labour (where all are
labourers and few employers) and by sea-fishing, the latter
so little congenial to their former habits. This cutting
down farms into lots was found so profitable, that over
the whole of this district, the sea-coast, where the shore
is accessible, is thickly studded with wretched cottages,
crowded with starving inhabitants. Ancient respectable
tenants, who passed the greater part of life in the enjoyment
of abundance, and in the exercise of hospitality
and charity, possessing stocks of ten, twenty, and thirty
breeding cows, with the usual proportion of other stock,
are now pining on one or two acres of bad land, with one
or two starved cows, and, for this accommodation a
calculation is made, that they must support their families
and pay the rent of their lots, which the land cannot
afford. When the herring fishery (the only fishery
prosecuted on this coast) succeeds, they generally satisfy
the landlords, whatever privations they may suffer,
but when the fishing fails, they fall in arrears, and are
sequestrated, and their stock sold to pay the rents, their
lots given to others, and they and their families turned
adrift on the world. The herring fishery, always precarious,
has, for a succession of years, been very defective,
and this class of people are reduced to extreme<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
misery. At first, some of them possessed capital, from
converting their farm stock into cash, but this has been
long exhausted. It is distressing to view the general
poverty of this class of people, aggravated by their
having once enjoyed abundance and independence;
and we cannot sufficiently admire their meek and patient
spirit, supported by the powerful influence of religious
and moral principle. There are still a few small tenants
on the old system, occupying the same farm jointly, but
they are falling fast to decay, and sinking into the new
class of cottars.”</p>

<p>This mode of sub-dividing small portions of inferior
land is bad enough certainly, and to propose the
establishment of villages, in a pastoral country, for the
benefit of men who can neither betake themselves to the
cultivation of the land nor to commerce for earning the
means of subsistence, is doubtless a refinement in policy
solely to be ascribed to the enlightened and enlarged
views peculiar to the new system. But, leaving out of
view the consideration that, from the prevalence of turning
corn lands into pasture, the demand for labour is
diminished, while the number of labourers is increased,
it can scarcely be expected that a man who had once been
in the condition of a farmer, possessed of land, and of
considerable property in cattle, horses, sheep, and money,
often employing servants himself, conscious of his independence,
and proud of his ability to assist others,
should, without the most poignant feelings, descend to
the rank of a hired labourer, even where labour and payment
can be obtained, more especially if he must serve
on the farms or in the country where he formerly commanded
as a master.</p>

<p>It is not easy for those who live in a country like
England, where so many of the lower orders have nothing
but what they acquire by the labour of the passing day,
and possess no permanent property or share in the agricultural
produce of the soil, to appreciate the nature of
the spirit of independence which is generated in countries
where the free cultivators of the soil constitute the
major part of the population. It can scarcely be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
imagined how proudly a man feels, however small his
property may be, when he has a spot of arable land and
pasture, stocked with corn, horses, and cows, a species
of property which, more than any other, binds him, by
ties of interest and attachment, to the spot with which he
is connected. He considers himself an independent person,
placed in a station in society far above the day
labourer, who has no stake in the permanency of existing
circumstances, beyond the prospect of daily employment;
his independence being founded on permanent property,
he has an interest in the welfare of the state, by supporting
which he renders his own property more secure, and,
although the value of the property may not be great, it
is every day in his view; his cattle and horses feed around
him; his grass and corn he sees growing and ripening;
his property is visible to all observers, which is calculated
to raise the owner in general consideration; and when a
passing friend or neighbour praises his thriving crops
and his cattle, his heart swells with pleasure, and he
exerts himself to support and to preserve that government
and those laws which render it secure. Such is
the case in many parts of the world; such was formerly
the case in Scotland, and is still in many parts of the
Highlands. Those who wish to see only the two castes
of capitalists and day-labourers, may smile at this union
of independence and poverty. But, that the opposite
system is daily quenching the independent spirit of the
Highlanders, is an undoubted fact, and gives additional
strength to the arguments of those who object to the reduction
of the agricultural population, and regret their
removal to the great towns, and to the villages in preparation
in some parts of the country.</p>

<p>It is painful to dwell on this subject, but as information
communicated by men of honour, judgment, and perfect
veracity, descriptive of what they daily witness, affords
the best means of forming a correct judgment, and as
these gentlemen, from their situations in life, have no
immediate interest in the determination of the question,
beyond what is dictated by humanity and a love of truth,
their authority may be considered as undoubted.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span></p>

<p>The following extract of a letter from a friend, as well as
the extract already quoted, is of this description. Speaking
of the settlers on the new allotments, he <span class="lock">says:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>“I scarcely need tell you that these wretched people
exhibit every symptom of the most abject poverty, and
the most helpless distress. Their miserable lots in the
moors, notwithstanding their utmost labour and strictest
economy, have not yielded them a sufficient crop for the
support of their families for three months. The little
money they were able to derive from the sale of their
stock has, therefore, been expended in the purchase of
necessaries, and is now wholly exhausted. Though they
have now, therefore, overcome all their scruples about
leaving their native land, and possess the most ardent
desire to emigrate, in order to avoid more intolerable evils
of starvation, and have been much encouraged by the
favourable accounts they have received from their
countrymen already in America, they cannot possibly
pay the expense of transporting themselves and their
families thither.”</p>

<p>It has been said that an old Highlander warned his
countrymen “to take care of themselves, for the law
had reached Ross-shire.” When his fears were excited
by vague apprehensions of change, he could not well
anticipate that the introduction of civil order, and the
extension of legal authority, which in an enlightened
age tend to advance the prosperity as well as promote the
security of a nation, should have been to his countrymen
either the signals of banishment from their native country,
or the means of lowering the condition of those who
were permitted to remain. With more reason it might
have been expected that the principles of an enlightened
age would have gradually introduced beneficial changes
among the ancient race; that they would have softened
down the harsher features of their character, and prepared
them for habits better suited to the cultivation
of the soil, than the indolent freedom of a pastoral life.
Instead of this, the new system, whatever may be its
intrinsic merits or defects, has, in too many cases, been
carried into execution in a manner which has excited<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
the strongest and most indignant sensations in the
breasts of those who do not overlook the present inconvenience
and distress of the many, in the eager pursuit
of a prospective advantage to the few. The consequences
which have resulted, and the contrast between
the present and past condition of the people, and between
their present and past disposition and feelings towards
their superiors, show, in the most striking light, the
impolicy of attempting, with such unnatural rapidity,
innovations which it would require an age, instead of a
few years, to accomplish in a salutary manner, and the
impossibility of effecting them without inflicting great
misery, endangering morals, and undermining loyalty
to the king, and respect for constituted authority.</p>

<p>A love of change, proceeding from the actual possession
of wealth, or from the desire of acquiring it, disturbs, by
an ill-directed influence, the gradual and effectual progress
of those improvements which, instead of benefiting
the man of capital alone, should equally distribute their
advantages to all. In the prosecution of recent changes
in the north, it would appear that the original inhabitants
were never thought of, nor included in the system
which was to be productive of such wealth to the landlord,
the man of capital, and the country at large,&mdash;and that
no native could be intrusted with, or, perhaps, none was
found hardy enough to act a part in the execution of
plans which commenced with the ejectment of their
unfortunate friends and neighbours. Strangers were,
therefore, called in, and whole glens cleared of their
inhabitants, who, in some instances, resisted these
mandates (although legally executed), in the hope of
preserving to their families their ancient homes, to which
all were enthusiastically attached. These people, blameless
in every respect, save their poverty and ignorance
of modern agriculture, could not believe that such harsh
measures proceeded from their honoured superiors, who
had hitherto been kind, and to whom they themselves
had ever been attached and faithful. The whole was
attributed to the acting agents, and to them, therefore,
their indignation was principally directed; and, in some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
instances, their resistance was so obstinate, that it became
necessary to enforce the orders “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">vi et armis</span>,” and to have
recourse to a mode of ejectment, happily long obsolete,
by setting their houses on fire. This last species of legal
proceeding was so peculiarly conclusive and forcible that
even the stubborn Highlanders, with all their attachment
to the homes of their fathers, were compelled to
yield.</p>

<p>In the first instances of this mode of removing refractory
tenants, a small compensation (six shillings),
in two separate sums, was allowed for the houses destroyed.
Some of the ejected tenants were also allowed
small allotments of land, on which they were to build
houses at their own expense, no assistance being given
for that purpose. Perhaps it was owing to this that they
were the more reluctant to remove till they had built
houses on their new stations. The compensations allowed
in the more recent removals are stated to have been
more liberal; and the improvements which have
succeeded those summary ejectments of the ancient
inhabitants are highly eulogised both in pamphlets and
newspapers.</p>

<p>Some people may, however, be inclined to doubt the
advantages of improvements which called for such
frequent apologies; for, if more lenient measures had
been pursued, vindication would have, perhaps, been
unnecessary, and the trial of one of the acting agents
might have been avoided.</p>

<p>This trial was brought forward at the instance of the
Lord Advocate, in consequence of the loud cry of indignation
raised in the country against proceedings
characterised by the sheriff of the county as “conduct
which has seldom disgraced any country.” But the
trial ended (as was expected by every person who understood
the circumstances) in the acquittal of the acting
agent, the verdict of the jury proceeding on the principle
that he acted under legal authority. This acquittal,
however, did by no means diminish the general feeling of
culpability; it only transferred the offence from the agent
to a quarter too high and too distant to be directly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
affected by public indignation, if, indeed, there be any
station so elevated, or so distant, that public indignation,
justly excited, will not, sooner or later, reach, so as to
touch the feelings, however obtuse, of the transgressor
of that law of humanity written on every upright mind,
and deeply engraved on every kind and generous heart.</p>

<p>It must, however, be a matter of deep regret, that such
a line of proceeding was pursued with regard to these
brave, unfortunate, and well-principled people, as excited
a sensation of horror, and a conviction of culpability,
so powerful as only to be removed by an appeal to a
criminal court. It is no less to be deplored that any
conduct sanctioned by authority, even although productive
of ultimate advantage (and how it can produce
any advantage beyond what might have been obtained
by pursuing a scheme of conciliation and encouragement
is a very questionable point), should have, in the first
instance, inflicted such general misery. More humane
measures would undoubtedly have answered every
good purpose; and had such a course been pursued,
as an enlightened humanity would have suggested, instead
of depopulated glens and starving peasantry,
alienated from their superiors, and, in the exacerbation
of their feelings, too ready to imbibe opinions hostile to
the best interests of their country, we should still have
seen a high-spirited and loyal people, ready, at the nod of
their respected chiefs, to embody themselves into regiments,
with the same zeal as in former times; and when
enrolled among the defenders of their country, to exhibit
a conduct honourable to that country and to their
profession. Such is the acknowledged character of the
men of these districts as soldiers, when called forth in the
service of their country, although they be now described
as irregular in their habits, and a burthen on the lands
which gave them birth, and on which their forefathers
maintained the honour, and promoted the wealth and
prosperity of the ancestors of those who now reject them.</p>

<p>But is it conceivable that the people at home should be
so degraded, while their brothers and sons who become
soldiers maintain an honourable character? The people<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
ought not to be reproached with incapacity or immorality
without better evidence than that of their prejudiced
and unfeeling calumniators. If it be so, however, and
if this virtuous and honourable race, which has contributed
to raise and uphold the character of the British
peasantry in the eyes of all Europe, are thus fallen, and so
suddenly fallen, how great and powerful must be the
cause, and how heavy the responsibility of its authors?
But if at home they are thus low in character, how unparalleled
must be the improvement which is produced by
difference of profession, as for example, when they
become soldiers, and associate in barracks with troops
of all characters, or in quarters, or billets, with the lowest
of the people, instead of mingling with such society as
they left in their native homes? Why should these
Highlanders be at home so degenerate as they are represented,
and as in recent instances they would actually
appear to be? And why, when they mount the cockade,
are they found to be so virtuous and regular, that one
thousand men of Sutherland have been embodied four
and five years together, at different and distant periods,
from 1759 to 1763, from 1779 to 1783, and from 1793 to
1798, without an instance of military punishment?
These men performed all the duties of soldiers to the
perfect satisfaction of their commanders, and continued
so unexceptionable in their conduct down to the latest
period, when embodied into the 93rd regiment, that,
according to the words of a distinguished general officer,
“Although the youngest regiment in the service, they
might form an example to all:” and on general parades
for punishment, the Sutherland Highlanders have been
ordered to their quarters, as “examples of this kind were
not necessary for such honourable soldiers.”</p>

<p>General Stewart adds the following in the third edition
of his <cite>Sketches</cite>, published in <span class="lock">1825:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>The great changes which have taken place in the above
parishes of Sutherland, and some others, have excited
a warm and general interest. While the liberal expenditure
of capital was applauded by all, many intelligent
persons lamented that its application was so much in one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
direction; that the ancient tenantry were to have no
share in this expenditure; and that so small a portion
was allotted for the future settlement of the numerous
population who had been removed from their farms, and
were placed in situations so new, and in many respects
so unsuitable,&mdash;certain that, in the first instance, great
distress, disaffection, and hostility towards the landlords
and government, with a diminution of that spirit
of independence, and those proper principles which had
hitherto distinguished them, would be the inevitable
result. So sudden and universal a change of station,
habits, and circumstances, and their being reduced from
the state of independent tenants to that of cottagers and
day-labourers, could not fail of arresting the notice of the
public.</p>

<p>Anxious to obtain the best information on this interesting
subject, I early made the most minute enquiry, careful,
at the same time, to form no opinion on intelligence
communicated by the people of the district, or by persons
connected with them, and who would naturally be interested
in, and prejudiced against, or in favour of those
changes. I was the more desirous for the best information
as the statements published with regard to the
character, capability, and principles of the people, exhibited
a perfect contrast to my own personal experience
and knowledge of the admirable character and exemplary
conduct of that portion of them that had left their native
country; and I believe it improbable, nay impossible,
that the sons of worthless parents, without religious or
moral principle&mdash;as they have been described&mdash;could
conduct themselves in such an honourable manner as to
be held up as an example to the British army. But,
indeed, as to information, so much publicity had been
given by various statements explanatory of, and in vindication
of these proceedings, that little more was necessary,
beyond what these publications afforded, to show
the nature of the plans, and the manner in which they
were carried into execution.</p>

<p>Forming my opinions, therefore, from those statements,
and from information communicated by persons not im<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>mediately
connected with that part of the country, I
drew the conclusions which appeared in the former editions
of these <cite>Sketches</cite>. But, with a strong desire to be
correct and well informed in all I state, and with an
intention of correcting myself, in this edition, should I
find that I had been misinformed, or had taken up mistaken
views of the subject, in the different statements
I had produced, I embraced the first spare time I could
command, and in autumn, 1823, I travelled over the
“improved” districts, and a large portion of those parts
which had been depopulated and laid out in extensive
pastoral farms, as well as the stations in which the people
are placed. After as strict an examination as circumstances
permitted, and a careful inquiry among those
who, from their knowledge and judgment were enabled
to form the best opinions, I do not find that I have one
statement to alter, or one opinion to correct; though I
am fully aware that many hold very different opinions.</p>

<p>But however much I may differ in some points, there
is one in which I warmly and cordially join; and that
is, in expressing my high satisfaction and admiration at
the liberality displayed in the immense sums expended on
buildings, in enclosing, clearing, and draining land, in
forming roads and communications, and introducing the
most improved agricultural implements. In all these,
the generous distribution of such exemplary encouragement
stands unparalleled and alone. Equally remarkable
is the great abatement of rents given to the tenants of
capital&mdash;abatements which it was not to be expected
they would ask, considering the preference and encouragement
given them, and the promises they had held out
of great and unprecedented revenue, from their skill and
exertions. But these promises seem to have been early
forgotten; the tenants of capital were the first to call for
relief; and so great and generous has this relief been that
the rents are reduced so low as to be almost on a level
with what they were when the great changes commenced.
Thus while upwards of £210,000 have been expended
on improvements, no return is to be looked for from this
vast expenditure; and in the failure of their promised<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
rents, the tenants have sufficiently proved the unstable
and fallacious nature of the system which they, with so
much plausibility and perseverance, got established by
delusions, practised on a high-minded, honourable
individual, not aware of the evils produced by so universal
a movement of a whole people. Every friend to a brave
and valuable race must rejoice that these evils are in
progress of alleviation by a return of that kindness and
protection which had formerly been so conspicuous
towards that race of tenantry, and which could never
have been interrupted had it not been for those delusions
to which I have more than once alluded, and which
have been prosecuted, within the last twenty years, in
many parts of the Highlands, with a degree of assiduity
and antipathy to the unfortunate inhabitants altogether
remarkable.</p>

<h3>HUGH MILLER ON THE SUTHERLAND
CLEARANCES.<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></h3>

<p>So much has been already said about these disastrous
Sutherland evictions that we greatly fear the reader
is sickened with the horrid narrative, but as it is
intended to make the present record of these atrocious
proceedings, not only in Sutherland but throughout the
whole Highlands, as complete as it is now possible to
make it, we shall yet place before the reader at considerable
length Hugh Miller’s observations on this National
Crime&mdash;especially as his remarks largely embody the
philosophical views and conclusions of the able and far-seeing
French writer Sismondi, who in his great work
declares:&mdash;“It is by a cruel use of legal power&mdash;it is by an
unjust usurpation&mdash;that the tacksman and the tenant of
Sutherland are considered as having no right to the land
which they have occupied for so many ages.... A
count or earl has no more right to expel from their
homes the inhabitants of his county, than a king to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
expel from his country the inhabitants of his kingdom.”
Hugh Miller introduces his remarks on Sutherland by a
reference to the celebrated Frenchman’s work, and his
opinion of the Sutherland Clearances, <span class="lock">thus:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>There appeared at Paris, about five years ago, a
singularly ingenious work on political economy, from
the pen of the late M. de Sismondi, a writer of
European reputation. The greater part of the first
volume is taken up with discussions on territorial
wealth, and the condition of the cultivators of the soil;
and in this portion of the work there is a prominent place
assigned to a subject which perhaps few Scotch readers
would expect to see introduced through the medium of a
foreign tongue to the people of a great continental state.
We find this philosophic writer, whose works are known
far beyond the limits of his language, devoting an entire
essay to the case of the Duchess of Sutherland and her
tenants, and forming a judgment on it very unlike the
decision of political economists in our own country, who
have not hesitated to characterise her great and singularly
harsh experiment, whose worst effects we are but beginning
to see, as at once justifiable in itself and happy in
its results. It is curious to observe how deeds done as if
in darkness and in a corner, are beginning, after the lapse
of nearly thirty years, to be proclaimed on the house-tops.
The experiment of the late Duchess was not intended to
be made in the eye of Europe. Its details would ill bear
the exposure. When Cobbett simply referred to it,
only ten years ago, the noble proprietrix was startled,
as if a rather delicate family secret was on the eve of
being divulged; and yet nothing seems more evident
now than that civilised man all over the world is to be
made aware of how the experiment was accomplished,
and what it is ultimately to produce.</p>

<p>In a time of quiet and good order, when law, whether in
the right or the wrong, is all-potent in enforcing its findings,
the argument which the philosophic Frenchman
employs in behalf of the ejected tenantry of Sutherland
is an argument at which proprietors may afford to smile.
In a time of revolution, however, when lands change<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
their owners, and old families give place to new ones,
it might be found somewhat formidable,&mdash;sufficiently
so, at least, to lead a wise proprietor in an unsettled age
rather to conciliate than oppress and irritate the class
who would be able in such circumstances to urge it with
most effect. It is not easy doing justice in a few sentences
to the facts and reasonings of an elaborate essay; but
the line of argument runs <span class="lock">thus:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Under the old Celtic tenures&mdash;the only tenures, be it
remembered through which the Lords of Sutherland
derive their rights to their lands,&mdash;the <i>Klaan</i>, or children
of the soil, were the proprietors of the soil&mdash;“the whole
of Sutherland,” says Sismondi, belonged to “the men
of Sutherland.” Their chief was their monarch, and a
very absolute monarch he was. “He gave the different
<i>tacks</i> of land to his officers, or took them away from them,
according as they showed themselves more or less useful
in war. But though he could thus, in a military sense,
reward or punish the clan, he could not diminish in the
least the property of the clan itself;”&mdash;he was a chief,
not a proprietor, and had “no more right to expel from
their homes the inhabitants of his county, than a king to
expel from his country the inhabitants of his kingdom.”
“Now, the Gaelic tenant,” continues the Frenchman,
“has never been conquered; nor did he forfeit, on any
after occasion, the rights which he originally possessed;”
in point of right, he is still a co-proprietor with his captain.
To a Scotchman acquainted with the law of property as
it has existed among us, in even the Highlands, for the
last century, and everywhere else for at least two centuries
more, the view may seem extreme; not so, however,
to a native of the Continent, in many parts of which
prescription and custom are found ranged, not on the
side of the chief, but on that of the vassal. “Switzerland,”
says Sismondi, “which in so many respects resembles
Scotland,&mdash;in its lakes, its mountains, its
climate, and the character, manners, and habits of its
children,&mdash;was likewise at the same period parcelled out
among a small number of lords. If the Counts of Kyburgh,
of Lentzburg, of Hapsburg, and of Gruyeres,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
had been protected by the English laws, they would
find themselves at the present day precisely in the condition
in which the Earls of Sutherland were twenty
years ago. Some of them would perhaps have had the
same taste for <i>improvements</i>, and several republics would
have been expelled from the Alps, to make room for
flocks of sheep. But while the law has given to the
Swiss peasant a guarantee of perpetuity, it is to the Scottish
laird that it has extended this guarantee in the
British empire, leaving the peasant in a precarious
situation. The clan,&mdash;recognised at first by the captain,
whom they followed in war, and obeyed for their common
advantage, as his friends and relations, then as his soldiers,
then as his vassals, then as his farmers,&mdash;he has come
finally to regard as hired labourers, whom he may perchance
allow to remain on the soil of their common
country for his own advantage, but whom he has the
power to expel so soon as he no longer finds it for his
interest to keep them.”</p>

<p>Arguments like those of Sismondi, however much their
force may be felt on the Continent, would be formidable
at home, as we have said, in only a time of revolution,
when the very foundations of society would be unfixed,
and opinions set loose, to pull down or re-construct at
pleasure. But it is surely not uninteresting to mark
how, in the course of events, that very law of England
which, in the view of the Frenchman, has done the Highland
peasant so much less, and the Highland chief so
much more than justice, is bidding fair, in the case of
Sutherland at least, to carry its rude equalising remedy
along with it. Between the years 1811 and 1820, fifteen
thousand inhabitants of this northern district were ejected
from their snug inland farms, by means for which we
would in vain seek a precedent, except, perchance, in the
history of the Irish massacre.</p>

<p>But though the interior of the county was thus improved
into a desert, in which there are many thousands
of sheep, but few human habitations, let it not be supposed
by the reader that its general population was in
any degree lessened. So far was this from being the case,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
that the census of 1821 showed an increase over the census
of 1811 of more than two hundred; and the present
population of Sutherland exceeds, by a thousand, its
population before the change. The county has not
been depopulated&mdash;its population has been merely
arranged after a new fashion. The late Duchess found it
spread equally over the interior and the sea-coast, and in
very comfortable circumstances;&mdash;she left it compressed
into a wretched selvage of poverty and suffering that
fringes the county on its eastern and western shores,
and the law which enabled her to make such an arrangement,
maugre the ancient rights of the poor Highlander,
is now on the eve of stepping in, in its own clumsy way,
to make her family pay the penalty. The southern
kingdom must and will give us a poor-law; and then
shall the selvage of deep poverty which fringes the sea-coasts
of Sutherland avenge on the titled proprietor of
the county both his mother’s error and his own. If our
British laws, unlike those of Switzerland, failed miserably
in her day in protecting the vassal, they will more than
fail, in those of her successor, in protecting the lord.
Our political economists shall have an opportunity of
reducing their arguments regarding the improvements
in Sutherland, into a few arithmetical terms, which the
merest tyro will be able to grapple with.</p>

<p>There is but poor comfort, however, to know, when
one sees a country ruined, that the perpetrators of the
mischief have not ruined it to their own advantage.
We purpose showing how signal in the case of Sutherland
this ruin has been, and how very extreme the infatuation
which continues to possess its hereditary lord. We
are old enough to remember the county in its original
state, when it was at once the happiest and one of the
most exemplary districts in Scotland, and passed, at two
several periods, a considerable time among its hills; we
are not unacquainted with it now, nor with its melancholy
and dejected people, that wear out life in their comfortless
cottages on the sea-shore. The problem solved in
this remote district of the kingdom is not at all unworthy
the attention which it seems but beginning to draw, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
which is already not restricted to one kingdom, or even
one continent.</p>

<p>But what, asks the reader, was the economic condition&mdash;the
condition with regard to circumstances and means
of living&mdash;of these Sutherland Highlanders? How did
they fare? The question has been variously answered:
much must depend on the class selected from among them
as specimens of the whole,&mdash;much, too, taking for granted
the honesty of the party who replies, on his own condition
in life, and his acquaintance with the circumstances
of the poorer people of Scotland generally. The county
had its less genial localities, in which, for a month or two
in the summer season, when the stock of grain from the
previous year was fast running out, and the crops on the
ground not yet ripened for use, the people experienced
a considerable degree of scarcity&mdash;such scarcity as a
mechanic in the South feels when he has been a fortnight
out of employment. But the Highlander had resources
in these seasons which the mechanic has not. He had
his cattle and his wild potherbs, such as the mug-wort and
the nettle. It has been adduced by the advocates of the
change which has ruined Sutherland, as a proof of the
extreme hardship of the Highlander’s condition, that at
such times he could have eaten as food broth made of
nettles, mixed up with a little oatmeal, or have had
recourse to the expedient of bleeding his cattle, and making
the blood into a sort of pudding. And it is quite true
that the Sutherlandshire Highlander was in the habit
at such times, of having recourse to such food. It is
not less true, however, that the statement is just as little
conclusive regarding his condition, as if it were alleged
that there must always be famine in France when the
people eat the hind legs of frogs, or in Italy when they
make dishes of snails. With regard to the general comfort
of the people in their old condition, there are better
tests than can be drawn from the kind of food they
occasionally ate. The country hears often of dearth in
Sutherland now. Every year in which the crop falls a
little below average in other districts, is a year of famine
there, but the country never heard of dearth in Suther<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>land
then. There were very few among the holders of
its small inland farms who had not saved a little money.
Their circumstances were such, that their moral nature
found full room to develop itself, and in a way the world
has rarely witnessed. Never were there a happier or
more contented people, or a people more strongly attached
to the soil; and not one of them now lives in the altered
circumstances on which they were so rudely precipitated
by the landlord, who does not look back on this period
of comfort and enjoyment with sad and hopeless regret.</p>

<p>But we have not yet said how this ruinous revolution
was effected in Sutherland,&mdash;how the aggravations of the
<em>mode</em>, if we may so speak, still fester in the recollections
of the people,&mdash;or how thoroughly that policy of the lord
of the soil, through which he now seems determined to
complete the work of ruin which his predecessor began,
harmonizes with its worst details. We must first relate,
however, a disastrous change which took place, in the
providence of God, in the noble family of Sutherland,
and which, though it dates fully eighty years back, may
be regarded as pregnant with the disasters which afterwards
befell the county.</p>

<p>The marriage of the young countess into a noble
English family was fraught with further disaster to the
county. There are many Englishmen quite intelligent
enough to perceive the difference between a smoky
cottage of turf, and a whitewashed cottage of stone,
whose judgments on their respective inhabitants would
be of but little value. Sutherland, as a county of men,
stood higher at this period than perhaps any other district
in the British Empire; but, as our descriptions
have shown, it by no means stood high as a county of
farms and cottages. The marriage of the countess
brought a new set of eyes upon it,&mdash;eyes accustomed to
quite a different face of things. It seemed a wild, rude
county, where all was wrong, and all had to be set right,&mdash;a
sort of Russia on a small scale, that had just got another
Peter the Great to civilize it,&mdash;or a sort of barbarous
Egypt, with an energetic Ali Pasha at its head. Even
the vast wealth and great liberality of the Stafford family<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
militated against this hapless county! It enabled them to
treat it as a mere subject of an interesting experiment,
in which gain to themselves was really no object,&mdash;nearly
as little so, as if they had resolved on dissecting a dog
alive for the benefit of science. It was a still farther
disadvantage, that they had to carry on their experiment
by the hands, and to watch its first effects with the
eyes, of others. The agonies of the dog might have had
their softening influence on a dissecter who held the knife
himself; but there could be no such influence exerted
over him, did he merely issue orders to his footman that
the dissection should be completed, remaining himself,
meanwhile, out of sight and out of hearing. The plan
of improvement sketched out by his English family was
a plan exceedingly easy of conception. Here is a vast
tract of land, furnished with two distinct sources of
wealth. Its shores may be made the seats of extensive
fisheries, and the whole of its interior parcelled out into
productive sheep farms. All is waste in its present
state; it has no fisheries, and two-thirds of its internal
produce is consumed by the inhabitants. It had contributed,
for the use of the community and the landlord, its
large herds of black cattle; but the English family saw,
and, we believe, saw truly, that for every one pound of
beef which it produced, it could be made to produce
two pounds of mutton, and perhaps a pound of fish in
addition. And it was resolved, therefore, that the
inhabitants of the central districts, who, as they were
mere Celts, could not be transformed, it was held, into
store farmers, should be marched down to the sea-side,
there to convert themselves into fishermen, on the
shortest possible notice, and that a few farmers of capital,
of the industrious Lowland race, should be invited to
occupy the new sub-divisions of the interior.</p>

<p>And, pray, what objections can be urged against so
liberal and large-minded a scheme? The poor inhabitants
of the interior had very serious objections to urge
against it. Their humble dwellings were of their own
rearing; it was they themselves who had broken in their
little fields from the waste; from time immemorial,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
far beyond the reach of history, had they possessed their
mountain holdings,&mdash;they had defended them so well
of old that the soil was still virgin ground, in which the
invader had found only a grave; and their young men
were now in foreign lands fighting at the command of
their chieftainess the battles of their country, not in the
character of hired soldiers, but of men who regarded
these very holdings as their stake in the quarrel. To
them, then, the scheme seemed fraught with the most
flagrant, the most monstrous injustice. Were it to be
suggested by some Chartist convention in a time of
revolution that Sutherland might be still further improved&mdash;that
it was really a piece of great waste to
suffer the revenues of so extensive a district to be squandered
by one individual&mdash;that it would be better to
appropriate them to the use of the community in general&mdash;that
the community in general might be still further
benefited by the removal of the said individual from
Dunrobin to a roadside, where he might be profitably
employed in breaking stones&mdash;and that this new arrangement
could not be entered on too soon&mdash;the noble Duke
would not be a whit more astonished, or rendered a whit
more indignant by the scheme than were the Highlanders
of Sutherland by the scheme of his predecessor.</p>

<p>The reader must keep in view, therefore, that if
atrocities unexampled in Britain for at least a century
were perpetrated in the clearing of Sutherland, there was
a species of at least passive resistance on the part of the
people (for active resistance there was none), which in
some degree provoked them. Had the Highlanders, on
receiving orders, marched down to the sea-coast and
become fishermen with the readiness with which a
regiment deploys on review day, the atrocities would,
we doubt not, have been much fewer. But though the
orders were very distinct, the Highlanders were very
unwilling to obey; and the severities formed merely
a part of the means through which the necessary obedience
was ultimately secured. We shall instance a single
case as illustrative of the process.</p>

<p>In the month of March, 1814, a large proportion of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
Highlanders of Farr and Kildonan, two parishes in Sutherland,
were summoned to quit their farms in the following
May. In a few days after, the surrounding heath on
which they pastured their cattle and from which, at that
season, the sole supply of herbage is derived (for in those
northern districts the grass springs late, and the cattle-feeder
in the spring months depends chiefly on the
heather), were set on fire and burnt up. There was that
sort of policy in the stroke which men deem allowable
in a state of war. The starving cattle went roaming over
the burnt pastures, and found nothing to eat. Many of
them perished, and the greater part of what remained,
though in miserable condition, the Highlanders had to
sell perforce. Most of the able-bodied men were engaged
in this latter business at a distance from home, when the
dreaded term-day came on. The pasturage had been
destroyed before the legal term, and while in even the eye
of the law it was still the property of the poor Highlanders;
but ere disturbing them in their dwellings,
term-day was suffered to pass. The work of demolition
then began. A numerous party of men, with a factor
at their head, entered the district, and commenced
pulling down the houses over the heads of the inhabitants.
In an extensive tract of country not a human
dwelling was left standing, and then, the more effectually
to prevent their temporary re-erection, the destroyers set
fire to the wreck. In one day were the people deprived
of home and shelter, and left exposed to the elements.
Many deaths are said to have ensued from alarm, fatigue,
and cold.</p>

<p>Our author then corroborates in detail the atrocities,
cruelties, and personal hardships described by Donald
MacLeod and proceeds:&mdash;But to employ the language of
Southey,</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
      <div class="verse">“Things such as these, we know, must be</div>
      <div class="verse">At every famous victory.”</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>And in this instance the victory of the lord of the soil over
the children of the soil was signal and complete. In little
more than nine years a population of fifteen thousand<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
individuals were removed from the interior of Sutherland
to its sea-coasts or had emigrated to America. The
inland districts were converted into deserts through
which the traveller may take a long day’s journey, amid
ruins that still bear the scathe of fire, and grassy patches
betraying, when the evening sun casts aslant its long deep
shadows, the half-effaced lines of the plough.</p>

<p>After pointing out how at the Disruption sites for
churches were refused, Hugh Miller proceeds:&mdash;We
have exhibited to our readers, in the <em>clearing</em> of Sutherland
a process of ruin so thoroughly disastrous, that it
might be deemed scarcely possible to render it more
complete. And yet with all its apparent completeness,
it admitted of a supplementary process. To employ one
of the striking figures of Scripture, it was possible to
grind into powder what had been previously broken
into fragments,&mdash;to degrade the poor inhabitants to a
still lower level than that on which they had been so
cruelly precipitated,&mdash;though persons of a not very
original cast of mind might have found it difficult to say
how the Duke of Sutherland has been ingenious enough
to fall on exactly the one proper expedient for supplementing
their ruin. All in mere circumstance and
situation that could lower and deteriorate had been
present as ingredients in the first process; but there
still remained for the people, however reduced to poverty
or broken in spirit, all in religion that consoles and
ennobles. Sabbath-days came round with their humanising
influences; and, under the teachings of the gospel,
the poor and the oppressed looked longingly forward
to a future scene of being, in which there is no poverty or
oppression. They still possessed, amid their misery,
something positively good, of which it was impossible
to deprive them; and hence the ability derived to the
present lord of Sutherland of deepening and rendering
more signal the ruin accomplished by his predecessor.</p>

<p>These harmonise but too well with the mode in which
the interior of Sutherland was cleared, and the improved
cottages of its sea-coasts erected. The plan has its two
items. No sites are to be granted in the district for Free<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
Churches, and no dwelling-houses for Free Church ministers.
The climate is severe,&mdash;the winters prolonged
and stormy,&mdash;the roads which connect the chief seats
of population with the neighbouring counties, dreary
and long. May not ministers and people be eventually
worn out in this way? Such is the portion of the plan
which his Grace and his Grace’s creatures can afford
to present to the light. But there are supplementary
items of a somewhat darker kind. The poor cotters are,
in the great majority of cases, tenants-at-will; and there
has been much pains taken to inform them that, to the
crime of entertaining and sheltering a Protesting minister,
the penalty of ejection from their holdings must inevitably
attach. The laws of Charles have again returned
in this unhappy district, and free and tolerating Scotland
has got, in the nineteenth century, as in the seventeenth,
its intercommuned ministers. We shall not say that the
intimation has emanated from the Duke. It is the misfortune
of such men that there creep around them
creatures whose business it is to anticipate their wishes;
but who, at times, doubtless, instead of anticipating
misinterpret them; and who, even when not very much
mistaken, impart to whatever they do the impress of
their own low and menial natures, and thus exaggerate
in the act the intention of their masters. We do not say,
therefore, that the intimation has emanated from the
Duke; but this we say, that an exemplary Sutherlandshire
minister of the Protesting Church, who resigned
his worldly all for the sake of his principles, had lately
to travel, that he might preach to his attached people,
a long journey of forty-four miles outwards, and as much
in return, and all this without taking shelter under cover
of a roof, or without partaking of any other refreshment
than that furnished by the slender store of provisions
which he had carried with him from his new home.
Willingly would the poor Highlanders have received him
at any risk; but knowing from experience what a Sutherlandshire
removal means he preferred enduring any
amount of hardship rather than that the hospitality of
his people should be made the occasion of their ruin.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
We have already adverted to the case of a lady of Sutherland
threatened with ejection from her home because
she had extended the shelter of her roof to one of the
Protesting clergy,&mdash;an aged and venerable man, who had
quitted the neighbouring manse, his home for many
years, because he could no longer enjoy it in consistency
with his principles; and we have shown that that aged
and venerable man was the lady’s own father. What
amount of oppression of a smaller and more petty character
may not be expected in the circumstances, when
cases such as these are found to stand but a very little
over the ordinary level?</p>

<p>The meannesses to which ducal hostility can stoop in
this hapless district, impress with a feeling of surprise.
In the parish of Dornoch for instance, where his Grace
is fortunately not the sole landowner, there has been a
site procured on the most generous terms from Sir George
Gunn Munro of Poyntzfield; and this gentleman, believing
himself possessed of a hereditary right to a quarry,
which, though on the Duke’s ground, had been long
resorted to by the proprietors of the district generally,
instructed the builder to take from it the stones which
he needed. Never had the quarry been prohibited
before, but on this occasion a stringent interdict arrested
its use. If his Grace could not prevent a hated Free
Church from arising in the district, he could at least add
to the expense of its erection. We have even heard
that the portion of the building previously erected had
to be pulled down and the stones returned.</p>

<p>How are we to account for a hostility so determined,
and that can stoop so low? In two different ways, we
are of opinion, and in both have the people of Scotland
a direct interest. Did his Grace entertain a very intense
regard for Established Presbytery, it is probably that he
himself would be a Presbyterian of the Establishment.
But such is not the case. The church into which he would
so fain force the people has been long since deserted by
himself. The secret of the course which he pursues
can have no connection therefore with religious motive
or belief. It can be no proselytising spirit that misleads<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
his Grace. Let us remark, in the first place, rather
however in the way of embodying a fact than imputing
a motive, that with his present views, and in his present
circumstances, it may not seem particularly his Grace’s
interest to make the county of Sutherland a happy or
desirable home to the people of Scotland. It may not
be his Grace’s interest that the population of the district
should increase. The clearing of the sea-coast may seem
as little prejudicial to his Grace’s welfare now as the
clearing of the interior seemed adverse to the interests
of his predecessor thirty years ago; nay, it is quite
possible that his Grace may be led to regard the clearing
of the coast as the better and more important clearing
of the two. Let it not be forgotten that a poor-law
hangs over Scotland,&mdash;that the shores of Sutherland are
covered with what seems one vast straggling village,
inhabited by an impoverished and ruined people,&mdash;and
that the coming assessment may yet fall so weighty that
the extra profits accruing to his Grace from his large
sheep-farms may go but a small way in supporting his
extra paupers. It is not in the least improbable that he
may live to find the revolution effected by his predecessor
taking to itself the form, not of a crime,&mdash;for that would
be nothing,&mdash;but of a disastrous and very terrible blunder.</p>

<p>There is another remark which may prove not unworthy
the consideration of the reader. Ever since the
completion of the fatal experiment which ruined Sutherland,
the noble family through which it was originated
and carried on have betrayed the utmost jealousy of
having its real results made public. Volumes of special
pleading have been written on the subject,&mdash;pamphlets
have been published, laboured articles have been inserted
in widely-spread reviews,&mdash;statistical accounts have been
watched over with the most careful surveillance. If
the misrepresentations of the press could have altered
the matter of fact, famine would not be gnawing the
vitals of Sutherland in a year a little less abundant than
its predecessors, nor would the dejected and oppressed
people be feeding their discontent, amid present misery,
with the recollections of a happier past. If a singularly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
well-conditioned and wholesome district of country has
been converted into one wide ulcer of wretchedness and
woe, it must be confessed that the sore has been carefully
bandaged up from the public eye,&mdash;that if there has
been little done for its cure, there has at least been much
done for its concealment. Now, be it remembered
that a Free Church threatened to insert a <em>tent</em> into this
wound and so keep it open. It has been said that the
Gaelic language removes a district more effectually from
the influence of English opinion than an ocean of three
thousand miles, and that the British public know better
what is doing in New York than what is doing in Lewis
or Skye. And hence one cause, at least, of the thick
obscurity that has so long enveloped the miseries which
the poor Highlander has had to endure, and the oppressions
to which he has been subjected. The Free Church
threatens to translate her wrongs into English, and to
give them currency in the general mart of opinion. She
might possibly enough be no silent spectator of conflagrations
such as those which characterised the first
general improvement of Sutherland,&mdash;nor yet of such
Egyptian schemes of house-building as that which formed
part of the improvements of a later plan. She might be
somewhat apt to betray the real state of the district
and thus render laborious misrepresentation of little
avail. She might effect a diversion in the cause of the
people, and shake the foundations of the hitherto despotic
power which has so long weighed them down. She might
do for Sutherland what Cobbett promised to do, but what
Cobbett had not character enough to accomplish, and
what did he not live even to attempt. A combination
of circumstances have conspired to vest in a Scottish
proprietor, in this northern district, a more despotic
power than even the most absolute monarchs of the
Continent possess; and it is, perhaps, no great wonder
that that proprietor should be jealous of the introduction
of an element which threatens, it may seem, materially
to lessen it. And so he struggled hard to exclude the
Free Church, and, though no member of the Establishment
himself, declares warmly in its behalf. Certain it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
is that from the Establishment as now constituted he
can have nothing to fear and the people nothing to hope.</p>

<p>After what manner may his Grace the Duke of Sutherland
be most effectually met in this matter, so that the
case of toleration and freedom of conscience may be
maintained in the extensive district which God, in his
providence, has consigned to his stewardship? We are
not unacquainted with the Celtic character as developed
in the Highlands of Scotland. Highlanders, up to a
certain point, are the most docile, patient, enduring of
men; but that point once passed, endurance ceases,
and the all too gentle lamb starts up an angry lion. The
spirit is stirred and maddens at the sight of the naked
weapon, and that in its headlong rush upon the enemy,
discipline can neither check nor control. Let our oppressed
Highlanders of Sutherland beware. They have
suffered much; but, so far as man is the agent, their
battles can be fought only on the arena of public opinion,
and on that ground which the political field may be soon
found to furnish.</p>

<p>Let us follow, for a little, the poor Highlanders of
Sutherland to the sea-coast. It would be easy dwelling
on the terrors of their expulsion, and multiplying facts of
horror; but had there been no permanent deterioration
effected in their condition, these, all harrowing and repulsive
as they were, would have mattered less. Sutherland
would have soon recovered the burning up of a few
hundred hamlets, or the loss of a few bed-ridden old
people, who would have died as certainly under cover,
though perhaps a few months later, as when exposed to
the elements in the open air. Nay, had it lost a thousand
of its best men in the way in which it lost so many at the
storming of New Orleans, the blank ere now would have
been completely filled up. The calamities of fire or of
decimation even, however distressing in themselves,
never yet ruined a country; no calamity ruins a country
that leaves the surviving inhabitants to develop, in their
old circumstances, their old character and resources.</p>

<p>In one of the eastern eclogues of Collins, where two
shepherds are described as flying for their lives before the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
troops of a ruthless invader, we see with how much of the
terrible the imagination of a poet could invest the evils of
war, when aggravated by pitiless barbarity. Fertile as
that imagination was, however, there might be found
new circumstances to heighten the horrors of the scene&mdash;circumstances
beyond the reach of invention&mdash;in the
retreat of the Sutherland Highlanders from the smoking
ruins of their cottages to their allotments on the coast.
We have heard of one man, named Mackay, whose family
at the time of the greater conflagration referred to by
Macleod, were all lying ill of fever, who had to carry two
of his sick children on his back a distance of twenty-five
miles. We have heard of the famished people blackening
the shores, like the crew of some vessel wrecked on an
inhospitable coast, that they might sustain life by the
shell-fish and sea-weed laid bare by the ebb. Many of
their allotments, especially on the western coast, were
barren in the extreme&mdash;unsheltered by bush or tree,
and exposed to the sweeping sea-winds, and in time of
tempest, to the blighting spray; and it was found a
matter of the extremest difficulty to keep the few cattle
which they had retained, from wandering, especially
in the night-time, into the better sheltered and more
fertile interior. The poor animals were intelligent enough
to read a practical comment on the nature of the change
effected; and, from the harshness of the shepherds to
whom the care of the interior had been entrusted, they
served materially to add to the distress of their unhappy
masters. They were getting continually impounded;
and vexatious fines, in the form of trespass-money, came
thus to be wrung from the already impoverished Highlanders.
Many who had no money to give were obliged
to relieve them by depositing some of their few portable
articles of value, such as bed or bodyclothes, or, more
distressing still, watches, and rings, and pins&mdash;the only
relics, in not a few instances, of brave men whose bones
were mouldering under the fatal rampart at New Orleans,
or in the arid sands of Egypt&mdash;on that spot of proud
recollection, where the invincibles of Napoleon went down
before the Highland bayonet. Their first efforts as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
fishermen were what might be expected from a rural
people unaccustomed to the sea. The shores of Sutherland,
for immense tracts together, are iron-bound, and
much exposed&mdash;open on the Eastern coast to the waves
of the German Ocean, and on the North and West to the
long roll of the Atlantic. There could not be more
perilous seas for the unpractised boatman to take his
first lessons on; but though the casualties were numerous
and the loss of life great, many of the younger Highlanders
became expert fishermen. The experiment was
harsh in the extreme, but so far, at least, it succeeded.
It lies open, however, to other objections than those which
have been urged against it on the score of its inhumanity.</p>

<h3>MR JAMES LOCH ON SUTHERLAND
IMPROVEMENTS.<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></h3>

<p>No country of Europe at any period of its history ever
presented more formidable obstacles to the improvement
of a people arising out of the prejudices and feelings of the
people themselves. To the tacksman, it is clear, from
what has already been stated, such a change could not be
agreeable. Its effect being to alter his condition, and
remove him from a state of idle independence, in habits
almost of equality with his chief, to a situation, although
fully, if not more respectable, yet one in which his livelihood
was to be obtained by his exertions and industry,
and in many instances by an application to pursuits,
which were by him considered as beneath the occupation
of a gentleman, although leading to real independence
and wealth, to a degree he never could arrive at in his
original condition. Nor could it be agreeable to him to
lose that command and influence, which he had hitherto
exercised without control, over his sub-tenants and de<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>pendants;
while it was at variance with every feeling
and prejudice in which he had been brought up and educated.
It required minds of no ordinary cast to rise
superior to these feelings: and men of no common
understanding and vigour of intellect were required, to
shake off habits so opposed to active industry and exertion.
From a certain set of this class, therefore, a real
and determined opposition to any change was to be
looked for. This expectation has not been disappointed;
and it is from individuals of this class, and persons connected
with them, that those false and malignant representations
have proceeded, which have been so loudly
and extensively circulated. Actuated by motives of a
mere personal nature, regardless of the happiness of the
people, whose improvement it was the great object of the
landlord to effect, they attempted to make an appeal in
favour of a set of people who were never before the
objects of their commiseration, in order that they might,
if possible, reduce them, for their own selfish purposes,
to that state of degradation from which they had been
just emancipated. This was, however, by no means true
of the whole, or of the greater part of this class of gentlemen;
for the bulk of the most active improvers of Sutherland
are natives, who, both as sheep farmers, and as skilful
and enterprising agriculturists, are equal to any to be
met with in the kingdom. They have, with an intelligence
and liberality of feeling which reflects upon them
the highest honour, embraced with alacrity the new scene
of active exertion presented for their adoption; seconding
the views of the landlords with the utmost zeal,
marked with much foresight and prudence. Out of the
twenty-nine principal tacksmen on the estate, seventeen
are natives of Sutherland, four are Northumbrians, two
are from the county of Moray, two from Roxburghshire,
two from Caithness, one from Midlothian, and one from
the Merse.</p>

<p>So strong, however, were the prejudices of the people,
that, even to those who were subjected to the power
and control of the tacksmen, this mode of life had charms
which attached them strongly to it. He extended, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
some degree, to the more respectable of those who were
placed under him, the same familiarity which he received
from the chief. The burden of the outdoor work was
cast upon the females. The men deemed such an occupation
unworthy of them, continued labour of any sort
being most adverse to their habits. They were contented
with the most simple and the poorest fare. Like all mountaineers,
accustomed to a life of irregular exertion, with
intervals of sloth, they were attached with a degree of
enthusiasm, only felt by the natives of a poor country,
to their own glen and mountainside, adhering in the
strongest manner to the habits and homes of their fathers.
They deemed no comfort worth the possessing, which was
to be purchased at the price of regular industry; no
improvement worthy of adoption, if it was to be obtained
at the expense of sacrificing the customs, or leaving the
homes of their ancestors. So strongly did these feelings
operate, that it cost them nearly the same effort to remove
from the spot in which they were born and brought up,
though the place of their new dwelling was situated on
the sea-shore at the mouth of their native strath, or even
in a neighbouring glen, as it cost them to make an exertion
equal to transporting themselves across the Atlantic.</p>

<p>The cattle which they reared on the mountains, and
from the sale of which they depended for the payment of
their rents, were of the poorest description. During
summer they procured a scanty sustenance, with much
toil and labour, by roaming over the mountains; while
in winter they died in numbers for the want of support;
notwithstanding a practice, which they universally
adopted, of killing every second calf, on account of the
want of winter keep. To such an extent did this calamity
at times amount, that, in the spring of 1807, there died
in the parish of Kildonan alone, two hundred cows, five
hundred head of cattle, and more than two hundred small
horses.</p>

<p>As soon as the works, undertaken under the direction
of the Parliamentary Commissioners, opened a prospect
of removing successfully the obstacles which stood in the
way of the improvements of the people, steps were taken<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
to new model and arrange these extensive possessions.
The utmost caution and deliberation was used in doing so,
and plans were never more maturely weighed, nor executed
with more anxiety and tenderness. To aid the
further arrangement of these matters, application was
made to William Young, Esq., of Inverugie, in the
county of Elgin, whose active mind and indefatigable
industry had been exhibited in what he had done upon
his own estate. This gentleman superintended the commencement
of those vast improvements which were
undertaken on the estate of Sutherland. The success
of the measures carried into effect under his direction,
combined with the difficulties he had to contend with,
must always be the best proof of the ability and indefatigable
zeal with which he executed the charge of
which he had taken the direction, and which he performed
so much to his own credit and the advantage of the
country. It is only doing justice to his merits to say, that
the rapidity of the earlier improvements was owing in a
principal degree to the impulse and action inspired by his
intelligent and enterprising mind. Mr. Young resigned
his superintendence in 1816, when the local management
of the estate of Sutherland was entrusted to the present
factor, Mr. Francis Suther, whose good temper and
judicious conduct in the immediate management at Trentham,
recommended him to the situation he now holds.
These expectations have been fully justified by the
manner he has executed the details of the late arrangements,
in which he received the most cordial and able
assistance from Captain John Mackay, late of the 26th
Foot, the factor of Strathnaver, and from Lieutenant
George Gunn, of the Royal Marines, Chief of the clan
Gunn, factor of Assynt.</p>

<p>These gentlemen deserve equal credit for the manner
in which they have enforced and promoted the plans
which were laid down for the extension of the fisheries
and the cultivation of the coast side, as for their kind and
careful conduct towards the people. Mr. Suther’s
exertions in promoting and carrying into effect every
arrangement which was made for the encouragement<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
and the success of the fishing station and village of Helmsdale,
requires particular commendation.</p>

<p>It is well known that the borders of the two kingdoms
were inhabited by a numerous population, who, in their
pursuits, manners, and general structure of society, bore a
considerable resemblance to that which existed in the
Highlands of Scotland. When the union of the crowns,
and those subsequent transactions which arose out of
that event, rendered the maintenance of that irregular
population not only unnecessary, but a burden to the
proprietor to whom the land belonged, the people were
removed, and the mountains were covered with sheep.
So that it had been for a length of time proved by the
experience of the stock farmers of those mountain tracts,
which comprise the northern districts of England, and the
southern parts of Scotland, that such situations were
peculiarly suited for the maintenance of this species of
stock. Taking this example as their guide, experience
had still further proved, that the central and western
Highlands of Scotland were equally well calculated for
the same end.</p>

<p>Reasoning from this success, and observing that the
climate of Sutherland, owing to its vicinity to the ocean,
and to its being considerably intersected by arms of the
sea, was much more moderate than this latter district,
it was fairly concluded that this county was even better
fitted for this system of management, than the heights
of Perthshire and Inverness-shire. The inferior elevation
of its mountains contributed still further to this
effect, and held out every encouragement to adopt the
same course which had been pursued with such success
in both parts of the kingdom.</p>

<p>The succession of those Alpine plants, which are common
to the Cheviot Hills, when they are put under sheep,
being also the natural herbage of the mountains of Sutherland,
renders them still more suitable to this mode of
occupation.</p>

<p>On the first melting of the snow, the cotton grass is
found to have been growing rapidly; it forms a healthy
and an abundant food for sheep, until about the begin<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>ning
of May, at which time it is in seed; when, after a
short interval, the deer hair takes its place, starting up
almost instantaneously, and forming, in the course of
one week (if the ground has been recently burnt,
and the weather be favourable), a green cover
to the mountains. This plant grows with several
varieties of bents, until the end of July, when the cotton
grass again begins to spring, and with the pry moss,
comes a second time into flower, in September, after
which the heather and more heating plants continue
until the frosts of winter. Nor is there any part of these
mountains, over which the sheep cannot roam with ease,
in search of food, rendering the whole available and profitable.</p>

<p>As there was every reason therefore for concluding,
that the mountainous parts of the estate and indeed of
the county of Sutherland, were as much calculated for
the maintenance of stock as they were unfit for the
habitation of man, there could be no doubt as to the propriety
of converting them into sheep walks, <em>provided</em>
the people could be at the same time settled in situations,
where, by the exercise of their honest industry, they could
obtain a decent livelihood, and add to the general mass
of national wealth, and where they should not be exposed
to the recurrence of those privations, which so frequently
and so terribly afflicted them, when situated among the
mountains. It was a matter of important consideration,
to determine how this was to be accomplished. The local
peculiarities of the county presented none of those advantages
in disposing of, and absorbing the surplus
population, which the borders of the two kingdoms, and
the southern and eastern highlands had enjoyed. Besides
it had made no approximation to the state in which
the rest of Scotland was placed, when those changes were
carried into effect. It had stood still in the midst of that
career of improvement which had so remarkably and so
splendidly distinguished the rest of the kingdom; and
remained separated by its habits, prejudices, and
language, from all around.</p>

<p>It had long been known, that the coast of Sutherland<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
abounded with many different kinds of fish, not only
sufficient for the consumption of the country, but affording
also a supply <em>to any extent</em>, for more distant markets
or for exportation, when cured and salted. Besides the
regular and continual supply of white fish, with which
the shores thus abound, the coast of Sutherland is
annually visited by one of those vast shoals of herrings,
which frequent the coast of Scotland. It seemed as if
it had been pointed out by Nature, that the system for
this remote district, in order that it might bear its suitable
importance in contributing its share to the
general stock of the country, was, to convert the
mountainous districts into sheep walks, and to
remove the inhabitants to the coast, or to the valleys
near the sea.</p>

<p>It will be seen, that the object to be obtained by this
arrangement, was two-fold: it was, in the first place,
to render this mountainous district contributory, as far
as it was possible, to the general wealth and industry
of the country, and in the manner most suitable to its
situation and peculiar circumstances. This was to be
effected by making it produce a large supply of wool,
for the staple manufactory of England. While, at the
same time, it should support as numerous, and a far more
laborious and useful population, than it hitherto had done
at home: and, in the second place, to convert the inhabitants
of those districts to the habits of regular and
continued industry, and to enable them to bring to market
a very considerable surplus quantity of provisions, for
the supply of the large towns in the southern parts of the
island, or for the purpose of exportation.</p>

<p>A policy well calculated to raise the importance, and
increase the happiness of the individuals themselves, who
were the objects of the change, to benefit those to whom
these extensive but hitherto unproductive possessions
belonged, and to promote the general prosperity of the
nation. Such was the system which was adopted. In
carrying it into effect, every care was taken to explain
the object proposed to be accomplished, to those who
were to be removed, and to point out to them, the ulti<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>mate
advantages that would necessarily accrue to them,
from their completion.</p>

<p>These communications were made to the people by the
factor personally, or by written statements, communicated
to them by the ground officers. That nothing
might be omitted in this respect, the different ministers,
and the principal tacksmen connected with the districts
which were to be newly arranged, were written to, explaining
to them, fully and explicitly, the intentions of
the proprietors in adopting them. It was particularly
requested of these gentlemen, that they would impress
upon the minds of the people, the propriety of agreeing
to them, and of explaining, that the motives which
dictated this step, arose out of a real regard for their
interests and prosperity, as well as for the general improvement
of the estate.</p>

<p>It was distinctly admitted, that it was not to be expected,
that the people should be immediately reconciled
to them. Such was to expect more than it was possible
to hope for. But it was represented, that if this was so
fully felt, and so clearly admitted, that the landlords
must have been strongly and conscientiously impressed
with the necessity and propriety of the measures adopted,
as tending directly to the happiness of those placed under
their protection. These representations had the desired
effect, and nothing can be more praiseworthy, or deserve
more to be applauded, than the conduct of the people
on quitting their original habitations; for although they
left them with much regret, they did so in the most quiet,
orderly, and peaceable manner.</p>

<p>If, upon one occasion, in the earlier years of these arrangements,
a momentary feeling of a contrary nature was
exhibited, it arose entirely from the misconduct of persons
whose duty it was to have recommended and enforced
obedience to the laws, in place of infusing into the minds
of the people, feelings of a contrary description. As soon,
however, as the interference of these persons was withdrawn,
the poor people returned to their usual state of
quietness and repose. All the statements, giving a
different account of their conduct, are absolutely false,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
and a libel upon their good conduct and peaceable character.</p>

<p>These arrangements commenced in 1807, and have been
carried on from that period, as the different tacks expired,
and afforded an opportunity of doing so. Bad
years, and the failure of crops continuing to produce the
same miserable effects they had constantly occasioned
to that portion of the population, which still continued
to reside among the mountains. This calamity fell with
great severity upon them in the seasons of 1812-13 and
1816-17.</p>

<p>During the latter period they suffered the extremes
of want and of human misery, notwithstanding every aid
that could be given to them, through the bounty of their
landlords. Their wretchedness was so great, that after
pawning everything they were possessed of, to the fishermen
on the coast, such as had no cattle were reduced to
come down from the hills in hundreds, for the purpose of
gathering cockles on the shore. Those who lived in the
more remote situations of the country were obliged to
subsist upon broth made of nettles, thickened with a little
oatmeal. Those who had cattle had recourse to the still
more wretched expedient of bleeding them, and mixing
the blood with oatmeal, which they afterwards cut into
slices and fried. Those who had a little money came
down and slept all night upon the beach, in order to
watch the boat returning from the fishing, that they might
be in time to obtain a part of what had been caught.</p>

<p>In order to alleviate this misery, every exertion was
made by Lord Stafford. To those who had cattle he
advanced money to the amount of above three thousand
pounds.</p>

<p>To supply those who had no cattle, he sent meal into
the country to the amount of nearly nine thousand
pounds. Besides which, Lady Stafford distributed money
to each parish on the estate: in order that no pains nor
consideration might be wanting, it was arranged that the
gentleman who is at the head of his Lordship’s affairs,
the writer of this statement, should go to Dunrobin to
settle with the local management and the clergymen,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
what was the best and most effectual way of distributing
his Lordship’s relief. Similar means were taken by Lord
Reay, to alleviate the distresses of his people. While
such was the distress of those who still remained among
the hills, <em>it was hardly felt by those who had been settled
upon the coast</em>. Their new occupation, as fishermen,
rendered them not only independent of that which produced
the misery of their neighbours, but enabled them
at the same time, in some degree, to become contributors
towards their support, both by the fish they were able to
sell to them, and also by the regular payment of their
rents. While it need hardly be stated, that these
wretched sufferers not only required to be relieved, but
failed entirely in the payment of what they owed the landlord.</p>

<h3>MRS. HARRIET BEECHER STOWE ON THE
SUTHERLAND CLEARANCES.<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></h3>

<p>As to those ridiculous stories about the Duchess of
Sutherland, which have found their way into many of the
prints in America, one has only to be here, moving in
society, to see how excessively absurd they are.</p>

<p>All my way through Scotland, and through England,
I was associating, from day to day, with people of every
religious denomination, and every rank of life. I have
been with dissenters and with churchmen; with the
national Presbyterian church and the free Presbyterian;
with Quakers and Baptists.</p>

<p>In all these circles I have heard the great and noble
of the land freely spoken of and canvassed, and if there
had been the least shadow of a foundation for any such
accusations, I certainly should have heard it recognized
in some manner. If in no other, such warm friends as
I have heard speak would have alluded to the subject
in the way of defence; but I have actually never heard
any allusion of any sort, as if there was anything to be
explained or accounted for.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span></p>
<p>As I have before intimated, the Howard family, to
which the duchess belongs, is one which has always been
on the side of popular rights and popular reform. Lord
Carlisle, her brother, has been a leader of the people,
particularly during the time of the corn-law reformation,
and <em>she</em> has been known to take a wide and generous
interest in all these subjects. Everywhere that I have
moved through Scotland and England I have heard her
kindness of heart, her affability of manner, and her
attention to the feelings of others spoken of as marked
characteristics.</p>

<p>Imagine, then, what people must think when they find
in respectable American prints the absurd story of her
turning her tenants out into the snow, and ordering the
cottages to be set on fire over their heads because they
would not go out.</p>

<p>But, if you ask how such an absurd story could ever
have been made up, whether there is the least foundation
to make it on, I answer that it is the exaggerated report
of a movement made by the present Duke of Sutherland’s
father, in the year 1811, and which was part of a
great movement that passed through the Highlands of
Scotland, when the advancing progress of civilisation
began to make it necessary to change the estates from
military to agricultural establishments.</p>

<p>Soon after the union of the crowns of England and
Scotland, the border chiefs found it profitable to adopt
upon their estates that system of agriculture to which
their hills were adapted, rather than to continue the
maintenence of military retainers. Instead of keeping
garrisons, with small armies, in a district, they decided
to keep only so many as could profitably cultivate the
land. The effect of this, of course, was like disbanding
an army. It threw many people out of employ, and forced
them to seek for a home elsewhere. Like many other
movements which, in their final results, are beneficial
to society, this was at first vehemently resisted, and had
to be carried into effect in some cases by force. As I
have said, it began first in the southern counties of
Scotland, soon after the union of the English and Scottish<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
crowns, and gradually crept northward&mdash;one county
after another yielding to the change. To a certain
extent, as it progressed northward, the demand for
labour in the great towns absorbed the surplus population;
but when it came in to the extreme Highlands,
this refuge was wanting. Emigration to America now
became the resource; and the surplus population were
induced to this by means such as the Colonization Society
now recommends and approves for promoting emigration
to Liberia.</p>

<p>The first farm that was so formed on the Sutherland
estate was in 1806. The great change was made in
1811-12, and completed in 1819-20.</p>

<p>The Sutherland estates are in the most northern portion
of Scotland. The distance of this district from the more
advanced parts of the kingdom, the total want of roads,
the unfrequent communication by sea, and the want of
towns, made it necessary to adopt a different course in
regard to the location of the Sutherland population
from that which circumstances had provided in other
parts of Scotland, where they had been removed from the
bleak and uncultivable mountains. They had lots given
them near the sea, or in more fertile spots, where, by
labour and industry, they might maintain themselves.
They had two years allowed them for preparing for the
change, without payment of rent. Timber for their
houses was given, and many other facilities for assisting
their change.</p>

<p>The general agent of the Sutherland estate is Mr. Loch.
In a speech of this gentleman in the House of Commons
on the second reading of the Scotch Poor-Law Bill, June
12, 1845, he states the following fact with regard to the
management of the Sutherland estate during this period,
from 1811 to 1833, which certainly can speak for itself:
“I can state as from fact that, from 1811 to 1833, not one
sixpence of rent has been received from that county, but,
on the contrary, there has been sent there, for the benefit
and improvement of the people, a sum exceeding sixty
thousand pounds.”</p>

<p>Mr. Loch goes on in the same speech to say: “There<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
is no set of people more industrious than the people of
Sutherland. Thirty years since they were engaged in
illegal distillation to a very great extent; at the present
moment there is not, I believe, an illegal still in the
county. Their morals have improved as those habits
have been abandoned; and they have added many
hundreds, I believe thousands, of acres to the land in
cultivation since they were placed upon the shore.</p>

<p>“Previous to the change to which I have referred, they
exported very few cattle, and hardly anything else.
They were also, every now and then, exposed to all the
difficulties of extreme famine. In the years 1812-13,
and 1816-17, so great was the misery that it was necessary
to send down oatmeal for their supply to the amount of
nine thousand pounds, and that was given to the people.
But, since, industrious habits were introduced, and they
were settled within reach of fishing, no such calamity
has overtaken them. Their condition was then so low
that they were obliged to bleed their cattle during the
winter, and mix the blood with the remnant of meal they
had, in order to save from them starvation.</p>

<p>“Since then the country has improved so much that
the fish, in particular, which they exported, in 1815,
from one village alone, Helmsdale (which, previous to
1811, did not exist), amounted to five thousand three
hundred and eighteen barrels of herring, and in 1844
thirty-seven thousand five hundred and ninety-four
barrels, giving employment to about three thousand
nine hundred people. This extends over the whole
of the county, in which fifty-six thousand barrels were
cured.</p>

<p>“Do not let me be supposed to say that there are not
cases requiring attention: it must be so in a large population;
but there can be no means taken by a landlord,
or by those under him, that are not bestowed upon that
tenantry.</p>

<p>“It has been said that the contribution by the heritor
(the duke) to one kirk session for the poor was but six
pounds. Now, in the eight parishes which are called
Sutherland proper, the amount of the contribution of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
the Duke of Sutherland to the kirk session is forty-two
pounds a-year. That is a very small sum, but that sum
merely is so given because the landlord thinks that he
can distribute his charity in a more beneficial manner
to the people; and the amount of charity which he gives&mdash;and
which, I may say, is settled on them, for it is given
regularly&mdash;is above four hundred and fifty pounds a-year.</p>

<p>“Therefore the statements that have been made, so
far from being correct, are in every way an exaggeration
of what is the fact. No portion of the kingdom has
advanced in prosperity so much; and if the honourable
member (Mr. S. Crawford) will go down there, I will give
him every facility for seeing the state of the people,
and he shall judge with his own eyes whether my representation
be not correct. I could go through a great
many other particulars, but I will not trouble the House
now with them. The statements I have made are accurate,
and I am quite ready to prove them in any way that
is necessary.”</p>

<p>The same Mr. Loch has published a pamphlet, in which
he has traced out the effects of the system pursued on the
Sutherland estate, in many very important particulars.
It appears from this that previously to 1811 the people
were generally sub-tenants to middlemen, who exacted
high rents, and also various perquisites, such as the delivery
of poultry and eggs, giving so many days’ labour
in harvest time, cutting and carrying peat and stones for
building.</p>

<p>Since 1811 the people have become immediate tenants,
at a greatly diminished rate of rent, and released from all
these exactions. For instance, in two parishes, in 1812,
the rents were one thousand five hundred and ninety-three
pounds, and in 1823 they were only nine hundred
and seventy-two pounds. In another parish the reduction
of rents has amounted, on an average, to thirty-six
per cent. Previous to 1811 the houses were turf
huts of the poorest description, in many instances the
cattle being kept under the same roof with the family.
Since 1811 a large proportion of their houses have been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
rebuilt in a superior manner&mdash;the landlord having paid
them for their old timber where it could not be moved,
and having also contributed the new timber, with lime.</p>

<p>Before 1811 all the rents of the estates were used for the
personal profit of the landlord; but since that time, both
by the present duke and his father, all the rents have been
expended on improvements in the county, besides sixty
thousand pounds more which have been remitted from
England for the purpose. This money has been spent on
churches, school-houses, harbours, public inns, roads, and
bridges.</p>

<p>In 1811 there was not a carriage-road in the county,
and only two bridges. Since that time four hundred and
thirty miles of road have been constructed on the estate,
at the expense of the proprietor and tenants. There is
not a turnpike-gate in the county, and yet the roads are
kept perfect.</p>

<p>Before 1811 the mail was conveyed entirely by a foot
runner, and there was but one post-office in the county;
and there was no direct post across the county, but letters
to the north and west were forwarded once a month. A
mail-coach has since been established, to which the late
Duke of Sutherland contributed more than two thousand
six hundred pounds; and since 1834 mail-gigs have been
established to convey letters to the north and west coast,
towards which the Duke of Sutherland contributes three
hundred pounds a year. There are sixteen post-offices
and sub-offices in the county. Before 1811 there was
no inn in the county fit for the reception of strangers.
Since that time there have been fourteen inns either built
or enlarged by the duke.</p>

<p>Before 1811 there was scarcely a cart on the estate;
all the carriage was done on the backs of ponies. The
cultivation of the interior was generally executed with a
rude kind of spade, and there was not a gig in the county.
In 1845 there were one thousand one hundred and thirty
carts owned on the estate, and seven hundred and eight
ploughs, also forty-one gigs.</p>

<p>Before 1812 there was no baker, and only two shops.
In 1845 there were eight bakers and forty-six grocers’<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
shops, in nearly all of which shoe-blacking was sold to
some extent, an unmistakable evidence of advancing
civilization.</p>

<p>In 1808 the cultivation of the coast-side of Sutherland
was so defective that it was necessary often, in a fall of
snow, to cut down the young Scotch firs to feed the cattle
on; and in 1808 hay had to be imported. <em>Now</em> the coast
side of Sutherland exhibits an extensive district of land
cultivated according to the best principles of modern
agriculture; several thousand acres have been added to
the arable land by these improvements.</p>

<p>Before 1811 there were no woodlands of any extent on
the estate, and timber had to be obtained from a distance.
Since that time many thousand acres of woodland have
been planted, the thinnings of which, being sold to the
people at a moderate rate, have greatly increased their
comfort and improved their domestic arrangements.</p>

<p>Before 1811 there were only two blacksmiths in the
county. In 1845 there were forty-two blacksmiths and
sixty-three carpenters. Before 1829 the exports of the
county consisted of black cattle of an inferior description,
pickled salmon, and some ponies; but these were precarious
sources of profit, as many died in winter for want
of food; for example, in the spring of 1807, two hundred
cows, five hundred cattle, and more than two hundred
ponies died in the parish of Kildonan alone. Since that
time the measures pursued by the Duke of Sutherland,
in introducing improved breeds of cattle, pigs, and modes
of agriculture, have produced results in exports which
tell their own story. About forty thousand sheep and
one hundred and eighty thousand fleece of wool are exported
annually; also fifty thousand barrels of herring.</p>

<p>The whole fishing village of Helmsdale has been built
since that time. It now contains from thirteen to fifteen
curing yards covered with slate, and several streets with
houses similarly built. The herring fishery, which has
been mentioned as so productive, has been established
since the change, and affords employment to three
thousand nine hundred people.</p>

<p>Since 1811, also, a savings-bank has been established<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
in every parish, of which the Duke of Sutherland is
patron and treasurer, and the savings have been very
considerable.</p>

<p>The education of the children of the people has been a
subject of deep interest to the Duke of Sutherland. Besides
the parochial schools (which answer, I suppose, to
our district schools), of which the greater number have
been rebuilt or repaired at an expense exceeding what is
legally required for such purposes, the Duke of Sutherland
contributes to the support of several schools for
young females, at which sewing and other branches of
education are taught; and in 1844 he agreed to establish
twelve General Assembly schools, in such parts of the
county as were without the sphere of the parochial
schools, and to build schools and schoolmasters’ houses,
which will, upon an average, cost two hundred pounds
each; and to contribute annually two hundred pounds
in aid of salaries to the teachers, besides a garden and
cow’s grass; and in 1845 he made an arrangement with
the education committee of the Free Church, whereby no
child, of whatever persuasion, will be beyond the reach
of moral and religious education.</p>

<p>There are five medical gentlemen on the estate, three of
whom receive allowances from the Duke of Sutherland for
attendance on the poor in the districts in which they
reside.</p>

<p>An agricultural association, or farmers’ club, has been
formed under the patronage of the Duke of Sutherland, of
which the other proprietors in the county, and the larger
tenantry, are members, which is in a very active and
flourishing state. They have recently invited Professor
Johnston to visit Sutherland and give lectures on agricultural
chemistry.</p>

<p>The total population of the Sutherland estate is twenty-one
thousand seven hundred and eighty-four. To have
the charge and care of so large an estate, of course, must
require very systematic arrangements; but a talent
for system seems to be rather the forte of the English.</p>

<p>The estate is first divided into three districts, and each
district is under the superintendence of a factor, who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
communicates with the duke through a general agent.
Besides this, when the duke is on the estate, which is
during a portion of every year, he receives on Monday
whoever of his tenants wishes to see him. Their complaints
or wishes are presented in writing; he takes them
into consideration, and gives written replies.</p>

<p>Besides the three factors there is a ground officer, or
sub-factor, in every parish, and an agriculturist in the
Dunrobin district, who gives particular attention to
instructing the people in the best methods of farming.
The factors, the ground officers, and the agriculturists,
all work to one common end. They teach the advantages
of draining; of ploughing deep, and forming their
ridges in straight lines; of constructing tanks for saving
liquid manure. The young farmers also pick up a great
deal of knowledge when working as ploughmen or
labourers on the more immediate grounds of the estate.</p>

<p>The head agent, Mr. Loch, has been kind enough to put
into my hands a general report of the condition of the
estate, which he drew up for the inspection of the duke,
May 12, 1853, and in which he goes minutely over the
condition of every part of the estate.</p>

<p>One anecdote of the former Duke of Sutherland will
show the spirit which has influenced the family in their
management of the estate. In 1817, when there was
much suffering on account of bad seasons, the Duke of
Sutherland sent down his chief agent to look into the
condition of the people, who desired the ministers of
the parishes to send in their lists of poor. To his surprise
it was found that there were located on the estate a number
of people who had settled there without leave. They
amounted to four hundred and eight families, or two
thousand persons; and though they had no legal title
to remain where they were, no hesitation was shown in
supplying them with food in the same manner with those
who were tenants, on the sole condition that on the first
opportunity they should take cottages on the sea-shore,
and become industrious people. It was the constant
object of the duke to keep the rents of his poorer tenants
at a nominal amount.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span></p>

<p>What led me more particularly to inquire into these
facts was, that I received by mail, while in London, an
account containing some of these stories, which had been
industriously circulated in America. There were dreadful
accounts of cruelties practised in the process of inducing
the tenants to change their places of residence. The
following is a specimen of these <span class="lock">stories:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>“I was present at the pulling down and burning of the
house of William Chisholm, Badinloskin, in which was
lying his wife’s mother, an old, bed-ridden woman of
near one hundred years of age, none of the family being
present. I informed the persons about to set fire to the
house of this circumstance, and prevailed on them to
wait till Mr. Sellar came. On his arrival I told him of
the poor old woman, being a condition unfit for removal.
He replied, ‘The old witch! she has lived too long;
let her burn.’ Fire was immediately set to the house,
and the blankets in which she was carried were in flames
before she could be got out. She was placed in a little
shed, and it was with great difficulty they were prevented
from firing that also. The old woman’s daughter arrived
while the house was on fire, and assisted the neighbours
in removing her mother out of the flames and smoke,
presenting a picture of horror which I shall never forget but
cannot attempt to describe. She died within five days.”</p>

<p>With regard to this story, Mr. Loch, the agent, says:
“I must notice the only thing like a fact stated in the
newspaper extract which you sent to me, wherein Mr.
Sellar is accused of acts of cruelty towards some of the
people. This Mr. Sellar tested, by bringing an action
against the then Sheriff-substitute of the county. He
obtained a verdict for heavy damages. The Sheriff, by
whom the slander was propagated, left the county.
Both are since dead.”</p>

<p>Having, through Lord Shaftesbury’s kindness, received
the benefit of Mr. Loch’s corrections to this statement, I
am permitted to make a little further extract from his
reply. He <span class="lock">says:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>“In addition to what I was able to say in my former
paper, I can now state that the Duke of Sutherland has
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>received from one of the most determined opposers of the
measures, who travelled to the north of Scotland as editor
of a newspaper, a letter regretting all he had written on
the subject, being convinced that he was entirely misinformed.
As you take so much interest in the subject, I
will conclude by saying that nothing could exceed the
prosperity of the county during the past year; their
stock, sheep, and other things sold at high prices; their
crops of grain and turnips were never so good, and the
potatoes were free from all disease: rents have been
paid better than was ever known. * * * As an
instance of the improved habits of the farmers, no house
is now built for them that they do not require a hot bath
and water-closets.”</p>

<p>From this long epitome you can gather the following
results. First, if the system were a bad one, the Duchess
of Sutherland had nothing to do with it, since it was first
introduced in 1806, the same year her grace was born;
and the accusation against Mr. Sellar, dates in 1811, when
her grace was five or six years old. The Sutherland
arrangements were completed in 1819, and her grace was
not married to the duke till 1823, so that, had the arrangement
been the worst in the world, it is nothing to the
purpose so far as she is concerned.</p>

<p>As to whether the arrangement <em>is</em> a bad one, the facts
which have been stated speak for themselves. To my
view it is an almost sublime instance of the benevolent
employment of superior wealth and power in shortening
the struggles of advancing civilization, and elevating in
a few years a whole community to a point of education
and material prosperity, which, unassisted, they might
never have obtained.</p>

<h3>REPLY TO MRS. BEECHER STOWE BY
DONALD MACLEOD.<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a></h3>

<p>From the year 1812 to 1820, the whole interior of the
county of Sutherland&mdash;whose inhabitants were advancing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
rapidly in the science of agriculture and education, who
by nature and exemplary training were the bravest,
the most moral and patriotic people that ever existed&mdash;even
admitting a few of them did violate the excise laws,
the only sin which Mr. Loch and all the rest of their
avowed enemies could bring against them&mdash;where a
body of men could be raised on the shortest possible
notice that kings and emperors might and would be proud
of; and where the whole fertile valleys and straths
which gave them birth were in due season waving with
corn; their mountains and hill-sides studded with sheep
and cattle; where rejoicing, felicity, happiness, and true
piety prevailed; where the martial notes of the bagpipes
sounded and reverberated from mountain to glen, from
glen to mountain. I say, marvellous! in eight years
converted to a solitary wilderness, where the voice of man
praising God is not to be heard, nor the image of God upon
man to be seen; where you can set a compass with twenty
miles of a radius upon it, and go round with it full
stretched, and not find one acre of land within the circumference
which has come under the plough for the last
thirty years, except a few in the parishes of Lairg and
Tongue,&mdash;all under mute brute animals. This is the
advancement of civilization, is it not, madam?</p>

<p>Return now with me to the beginning of your elaborate
eulogy on the Duchess of Sutherland, and if you are open
to conviction, I think you should be convinced that I never
published nor circulated in the American, English, or
Scotch public prints any ridiculous, absurd stories about
her Grace of Sutherland. An abridgment of my lucubrations
is now in the hands of the public, and you may peruse
them. I stand by them as facts (stubborn chiels).
I can prove them to be so even in this country (Canada),
by a cloud of living witnesses, and my readers will find
that, instead of bringing absurd accusations against her
Grace, that I have endeavoured in some instances to
screen her and her predecessors from the public odium
their own policy and the doings of their servants merited.
Moreover, there is thirty years since I began to expostulate
with the House of Sutherland for their short<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>sighted
policy in dealing with their people as they were
doing, and it is twenty years since I began to expose them
publicly, with my real name, Donald MacLeod, attached
to each letter, sending a copy of the public paper where it
appeared, directed by post, to the Duke of Sutherland.
These exposing and remonstrating letters were published
in the Edinburgh papers, where the Duke and his predecessors
had their principal Scotch law agent, and you
may easily believe that I was closely watched, with the
view to find one false accusation in my letters, but they
were baffled. I am well aware that each letter I have
written on the subject would, if untrue, constitute a libel,
and I knew the editors, printers, and publishers of these
papers were as liable or responsible for libel as I was.
But the House of Sutherland could never venture to
raise an action of damages against either of us. In 1841,
when I published my first pamphlet, I paid $4 50c., for
binding one of them, in a splendid style, which I sent
by mail to his Grace the present Duke of Sutherland,
with a complimentary note requesting him to peruse it,
and let me know if it contained anything offensive or
untrue. I never received a reply, nor did I expect it;
yet I am satisfied that his Grace did peruse it. I posted a
copy of it to Mr. Loch, his chief commissioner; to Mr.
W. Mackenzie, his chief lawyer in Edinburgh; to every
one of their underlings, to sheep farmers, and ministers
in the county of Sutherland, who abetted the depopulators,
and I challenged the whole of them, and other
literary scourges who aid and justified their unhallowed
doings, to gainsay one statement I have made. Can you
or any other believe that a poor sinner like Donald
MacLeod would be allowed for so many years to escape
with impunity, had he been circulating and publishing
calumnious, absurd falsehoods against such personages
as the House of Sutherland? No, I tell you, if money
could secure my punishment, without establishing their
own shame and guilt, that it would be considered well-spent
long ere now,&mdash;they would eat me in penny pies
if they could get me cooked for them.</p>

<p>I agree with you that the Duchess of Sutherland is a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
beautiful, accomplished lady, who would shudder at the
idea of taking a faggot or a burning torch in her hand to
set fire to the cottages of her tenants, and so would her
predecessor, the first Duchess of Sutherland, her good
mother; likewise would the late and present Dukes of
Sutherland, at least I am willing to believe that they
would. Yet it was done in their name, under their
authority, to their knowledge, and with their sanction.
The dukes and duchesses of Sutherland, and those of
their depopulating order, had not, nor have they any call
to defile their pure hands in milder work than to burn
people’s houses; no, no, they had, and have plenty of
willing tools at their beck to perform their dirty work.
Whatever amount of humanity and purity of heart the
late or the present Duke and Duchess may possess or be
ascribed to them, we know the class of men from whom
they selected their commissioners, factors, and underlings.
I knew every one of the unrighteous servants who
ruled the Sutherland estate for the last fifty years, and
I am justified in saying that the most skilful phrenologist
and physiognomist that ever existed could not discern
one spark of humanity in the whole of them, from Mr.
Loch down to Donald Sgrios, or Damnable Donald,
the name by which the latter was known. The most
of those cruel executors of the atrocities I have been
describing are now dead, and to be feared but not
lamented. But it seems their chief was left to give you
all the information you required about British slavery
and oppression. I have read from speeches delivered
by Mr. Loch at public dinners among his own party,
“that he would never be satisfied until the Gaelic
language and the Gaelic people would be extirpated root
and branch from the Sutherland estate; yes, from the
Highlands of Scotland.” He published a book, where he
stated as a positive fact, “that when he got the management
of the Sutherland estate he found 408 families on
the estate who never heard the name of Jesus,”&mdash;whereas
I could make oath that there were not at that time, and
for ages prior to it, above two families within the limits
of the county who did not worship that Name and holy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
Being every morning and evening. I know there are
hundreds in the Canadas who will bear me out in this
assertion. I was at the pulling down and burning of the
house of William Chisholm. I got my hands burnt taking
out the poor old woman from amidst the flames of her
once-comfortable though humble dwelling, and a more
horrifying and lamentable scene could scarcely be witnessed.
I may say the skeleton of a once tall, robust,
high-cheek-boned, respectable woman, who had seen
better days; who could neither hear, see, nor speak;
without a tooth in her mouth, her cheek skin meeting in
the centre, her eyes sunk out of sight in their sockets,
her mouth wide open, her nose standing upright among
smoke and flames, uttering piercing moans of distress
and agony, in articulations from which could be only
understood, “<i lang="gd" xml:lang="gd">Oh, Dhia, Dhia, teine, teine</i>&mdash;Oh God,
God, fire, fire.” When she came to the pure air, her
bosom heaved to a most extraordinary degree, accompanied
by a deep hollow sound from her lungs, comparable
to the sound of thunder at a distance. When laid down
upon the bare, soft, moss floor of the roofless shed, I will
never forget the foam of perspiration which emitted and
covered the pallid death-looking countenance. This was
a scene, madam, worthy of an artist’s pencil, and of a
conspicuous place on the stages of tragedy. Yet you
call this a specimen of the ridiculous stories which found
their way into respectable prints, because Mr. Loch,
the chief actor, told you that Sellar, the head executive,
brought an action against the sheriff and obtained a
verdict for heavy damages. What a subterfuge; but
it will not answer the purpose, “<i>the bed is too short to
stretch yourself, and the covering too narrow and short to
cover you</i>.” If you took the information and evidence
upon which you founded your <cite>Uncle Tom’s Cabin</cite> from
such unreliable sources (as I said before), who can believe
the one-tenth of your novel? I cannot. I have at my
hand here the grandchild of the slaughtered old woman,
who recollects well of the circumstance. I have not far
from me a respectable man, an elder in the Free Church,
who was examined as a witness at Sellar’s trial, at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
Spring Assizes of Inverness, in 1816, which you will find
narrated in letters four and five of my work. Had you
the opportunity, madam, of seeing the scenes which I,
and hundreds more, have seen&mdash;the wild ferocious appearance
of the infamous <em>gang</em> who constituted the burning
party, covered over face and hands with soot and ashes of
the burning houses, cemented by torch-grease and their
own sweat, kept continually drunk or half-drunk while at
work; and to observe the hellish amusements some of
them would get up for themselves and for an additional
pleasure to their leaders! The people’s houses were
generally built upon declivities, and in many cases not
far from pretty steep precipices. They preserved their
meal in tight-made boxes, or chests, as they were called,
and when this fiendish party found any quantity of meal,
they would carry it between them to the brink, and dispatch
it down the precipice amidst shrieks and yells.
It was considered grand sport to see the box breaking to
atoms and the meal mixed with the air. When they
would set fire to a house, they would watch any of the
domestic animals making their escape from the flames,
such as dogs, cats, hens, or any poultry; these were caught
and thrown back to the flames&mdash;grand sport for demons
in human form!</p>

<p>As to the vaunted letter which his “Grace received
from one of the most determined opposers of the measures,
who travelled in the north of Scotland as editor of a
newspaper, regretting all that he had written on the subject,
being convinced that he was misinformed,” I may
tell you, madam, that this man did not travel to the
north or in the north of Scotland, as editor; his name was
Thomas Mulock; he came to Scotland a fanatic speculator
in literature in search of money, or a lucrative
situation, vainly thinking that he would be a dictator
to every editor in Scotland. He first attacked the
immortal Hugh Miller of the <cite>Witness</cite>, Edinburgh, but
in him he met more than his match. He then went to the
north, got hold of my first pamphlet, and by setting it up
in a literary style, and in better English than I, he made a
splendid and promising appearance in the northern<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
papers for some time; but he found out that the money
expected was not coming in, and that the hotels, head
inns, and taverns would not keep him up any longer
without the prospect of being paid for the past or for the
future. I found out that he was hard up, and a few of the
Highlanders in Edinburgh and myself sent him from
twenty to thirty pounds sterling. When he saw that
that was all he was to get, he at once turned tail upon us,
and instead of expressing his gratitude, he abused us
unsparingly, and regretted that ever he wrote in behalf
of such a hungry, moneyless class. He smelled (like others
we suspect) where the gold was hoarded up for hypocrites
and flatterers, and that one apologising letter to his
Grace would be worth ten times as much as he could
expect from the Highlanders all his lifetime; and I
doubt not it was, for his apology for the sin of misinformation
got wide circulation.</p>

<p>He then went to France and started an English paper in
Paris, and for the service he rendered Napoleon in crushing
republicanism during the besieging of Rome, etc., the
Emperor presented him with a <em>gold pin</em>, and in a few
days afterwards sent a <i>gendarme</i> to him with a brief
notice that his service was not any longer required, and a
warning to quit France in a few days, which he had to do.
What became of him after I know not, but very likely
he is dictating to young Loch, or some other Metternich.</p>

<p>No feelings of hostile vindictiveness, no desire to inflict
chastisement, no desire to make riches, influenced my
mind, pourtraying the scenes of havoc and misery which
in those past days darkened the annals of Sutherland. I
write in my own humble style, with higher aims, wishing
to prepare the way for demonstrating to the Dukes of
Sutherland, and all other Highland proprietors, great and
small, that the path of selfish aggrandisement and oppression
leads by sure and inevitable results, yea to the
ruin and destruction of the blind and misguided oppressors
themselves. I consider the Duke himself
victimised on a large scale by an incurably wrong system,
and by being enthralled by wicked counsellors and servants.
I have no hesitation in saying, had his Grace and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
his predecessors bestowed one-half of the encouragement
they had bestowed upon strangers on the aborigines&mdash;a
hardy, healthy, abstemious people, who lived peaceably
in their primitive habitations, unaffected with the vices
of a subtle civilization, possessing little, but enjoying
much; a race devoted to their hereditary chief, ready to
abide by his counsels; a race profitable in peace, and
loyal, available in war; I say, his Grace, the present
Duke of Sutherland, and his beautiful Duchess, would be
without compeers in the British dominions, their rents, at
least doubled; would be as secure from invasion and
annoyance in Dunrobin Castle as Queen Victoria could, or
can be, in her Highland residence, at Balmoral, and far
safer than she is in her English home, Buckingham
Palace; every man and son of Sutherland would be
ready, as in the days of yore, to shed the last drop of their
blood in defence of their chief, if required. Congratulations,
rejoicings, dancing to the martial notes of the
pipes, would meet them at the entrance to every glen and
strath in Sutherlandshire, accompanied, surrounded, and
greeted, as they proceeded, by the most grateful,
devotedly attached, happy, and bravest peasantry that
ever existed; yes, but alas! where there is nothing now,
but desolation and the cries of famine and want, to meet
the noble pair&mdash;the ruins of once comfortable dwellings&mdash;will
be seen the landmarks of the furrows and ridges
which yielded food to thousands, the footprints of the
arch-enemy of human happiness, and ravager&mdash;before,
after, and on each side, solitude, stillness, and the quiet
of the grave, disturbed only at intervals by the yells of a
shepherd, or fox-hunter, and the bark of a collie dog.
Surely we must admit that the Marquises and Dukes of
Sutherland have been duped and victimised to a most
extraordinary and incredible extent; and we have Mr.
Loch’s own words for it in his speech in the House of
Commons, June 21st, 1845: “I can state, as from facts,
that from 1811 to 1833, not one sixpence of rent has been
received from that county; but, on the contrary, there
has been sent there for the benefit and improvement
of the people a sum exceeding sixty thousand pounds<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
sterling.” Now think you of this immense wealth which
has been expended. I am not certain, but I think the
rental of the county would exceed £60,000 a year; you
have then from 1811 to 1833, twenty-two years, leaving
them at the above figures, and the sum total will amount
to £1,320,000 expended upon the self-styled Sutherland
improvements; add to this £60,000 sent down to preserve
the lives of the victims of those improvements
from death by famine, and the sum total will turn out
in the shape of £1,380,000. It surely cost the heads of
the house of Sutherland an immense sum of money to
convert the county into the state I have described it in a
former part of this work (and I challenge contradiction).</p>

<p>You should be surprised to hear and learn, madam,
for what purposes most of the money drained from the
Duke’s coffers yearly are expended since he became the
Duke and proprietor of Sutherland, upholding the Loch
policy. There are no fewer than seventeen who are
known by the name of water bailiffs in the county, who
receive yearly salaries, what doing, think you? Protecting
the operations of the Loch policy, watching day and night
the freshwater lakes, rivers, and creeks, teeming with the
finest salmon and trout fish in the world, guarding from
the famishing people, even during the years of famine and
dire distress, when many had to subsist upon weeds, sea-ware,
and shell-fish, yet guarded and preserved for the
amusement of English anglers; and what is still more
heartrending, to prevent the dying by hunger to pick up
any of the dead fish left by the sporting anglers rotting
on the lake, creek, and river sides, when the smallest of
them, or a morsel, would be considered by hundreds, I
may say thousands, of the needy natives, a treat; but
they durst not touch them, or if they did and were found
out to jail they were conducted, or removed summarily
from his Grace’s domains; (let me be understood, these
gentlemen had no use for the fish, killing them for amusement,
only what they required for their own use, and complimented
to the factors; they were not permitted to
cure them).</p>

<p>You will find, madam, that about three miles from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
Dunrobin Castle there is a branch of the sea which extends
up the county about six miles, where shell-fish, called
mussels, abound. Here you will find two sturdy men,
called mussel bailiffs, supplied with rifles and ammunition,
and as many Newfoundland dogs as assistants, watching
the mussel scalps, or beds, to preserve them from the
people in the surrounding parishes of Dornoch, Rogart, and
Golspie, and keep them, to supply the fishermen, on the
opposite side of the Moray Firth, with bait, who come
there every year and take away thousands of tons of this
nutritive shell-fish, when many hundreds of the people
would be thankful for a diet per day of them, to pacify
the cravings of nature. You will find that the unfortunate
native fishermen, who pay a yearly rent to his
Grace for bait, are only permitted theirs from the refuse
left by the strangers of the other side of the Moray Firth,
and if they violate the <em>iron</em> rule laid down to them, they
are entirely at the mercy of the underlings. There has
been an instance of two of the fishermen’s wives going
on a cold, snowy, frosty day to gather bait, but on account
of the boisterous sea, could not reach the place
appointed by the factors; one took what they required
from the forbidden ground, and was observed by some of
the bailiffs, in ambush, who pursued them like tigers.
One came up to her unobserved, took out his knife, and
cut the straps by which the basket or creel on her back
was suspended; the weight on her back fell to the ground,
and she, poor woman, big in the family way, fell her whole
length forward in the snow and frost. Her companion
turned round to see what had happened, when she was
pushed back with such force that she fell; he then trampled
their baskets and mussels to atoms, took them both
prisoners, ordered one of them to call his superior bailiff
to assist him, and kept the other for two hours standing,
wet as she was, among frost and snow, until the superior
came a distance of three miles. After a short consultation
upon the enormity of the crime, the two poor
women were led, like convicted criminals, to Golspie, to
appear before Lycurgus Gunn, and in that deplorable
condition were left standing before their own doors in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
the snow, until Marshall Gunn found it convenient to
appear and pronounce judgment,&mdash;verdict: You are
allowed to go into your houses this night; this day week
you must leave this village for ever, and the whole of the
fishermen of the village are strictly prohibited from
taking bait from the Little Ferry until you leave; my
bailiffs are requested to see this my decree strictly attended
to. Being the middle of winter and heavy snow,
they delayed a week longer: ultimately the villagers
had to expel the two families from among them, so that
they would get bait, having nothing to depend upon for
subsistence but the fishing, and fish they could not
without bait. This is a specimen of the injustice to and
subjugation of the Golspie fishermen, and of the people
at large; likewise of the purposes for which the Duke’s
money is expended in that quarter. If you go, then,
to the other side of the domain, you will find another
Kyle, or a branch of the sea, which abounds in cockles
and other shell-fish, fortunately for the poor people, not
forbidden by a Loch ukase. But in the years of distress,
when the people were principally living upon vegetables,
sea-weeds, and shell-fish, various diseases made their
appearance amongst them hitherto unknown. The
absence of meal of any kind being considered the primary
cause, some of the people thought they would be permitted
to exchange shell-fish for meal with their more
fortunate neighbours in Caithness, to whom such shell-fish
were a rarity, and so far the understanding went
between them, that the Caithness boats came up loaded
with meal, but the Loch embargo, through his underling
in Tongue, who was watching their movements, was at
once placed upon it; the Caithness boats had to return
home with the meal, and the Duke’s people might live or
die, as they best could. Now, madam, you have steeped
your brains, and ransacked the English language to find
refined terms for your panegyric on the Duke, Duchess,
and family of Sutherland. (I find no fault with you,
knowing you have been well paid for it.) But I would
briefly ask you (and others who devoted much of their
time and talents in the same strain), would it not be more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
like a noble pair&mdash;if they did merit such noble praise
as you have bestowed upon them&mdash;if they had, especially
during years of famine and distress, freely opened up all
these bountiful resources which God in His eternal
wisdom and goodness prepared for His people, and which
should never be intercepted nor restricted by man or men.
You and others have composed hymns of praise, which it
is questionable if there is a tune in heaven to sing them to.</p>

<p>But you shall find the Duke’s money is expended for
most astonishing purposes; not a little of it goes to hire
hypocrites, and renowned literary flatterers, to vindicate
the mal-administration of those to whom he entrusted
the management of his affairs, and make his Grace (who
is by nature a simple-minded man) believe his servants
are innocent of all the charges brought against them,
and doing justice to himself and to his people, when they
are doing the greatest injustice to both; so that instead of
calling his servants to account at any time, and enquiring
into the broad charges brought against them&mdash;as every
wise landlord should do&mdash;it seems the greater the enormities
of foul deeds they commit, and the louder their
accusations may sound through the land, the farther
they are received into his favour. The fact is, that
James Loch was Duke of Sutherland, and not the “tall,
slender man with rather a thin face, light brown hair,
and mild blue eyes,” who armed you up the extraordinary
elegant staircase in Stafford House.</p>

<p>The Duchess of Sutherland pays a visit every year to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
Dunrobin Castle, and has seen and heard so many supplicating
appeals presented to her husband by the poor
fishermen of Golspie, soliciting liberty to take mussels
from the Little Ferry Sands to bait their nets&mdash;a liberty
of which they were deprived by his factors, though paying
yearly rent for it; yet returned by his Grace with the
brief deliverance, that he could do nothing for them.
Can I believe that this is the same personage who can set
out from Dunrobin Castle, her own Highland seat, and
after travelling from it, then can ride in one direction
over thirty miles, in another direction forty-four miles, in
another, by taking the necessary circuitous route, sixty
miles, and that over fertile glens, valleys, and straths,
bursting with fatness, which gave birth to, and where were
reared for ages, thousands of the bravest, the most moral,
virtuous, and religious men that Europe could boast of;
ready to a man, at a moment’s warning from their chiefs,
to rise in defence of their king, queen, and country;
animated with patriotism and love to their chief, and
irresistible in the battle contest for victory? But these
valiant men had then a <em>country</em>, a <em>home</em>, and a <em>chief</em> worth
the fighting for. But I can tell her that she can now ride
over these extensive tracts in the interior of the county
without seeing the image of God upon a man travelling
these roads, with the exception of a wandering Highland
shepherd, wrapped up in a grey plaid to the eyes, with a
collie dog behind him as a drill sergeant to train his ewes
and to marshal his tups. There may happen to travel
over the dreary tract a geologist, a tourist, or a lonely
carrier, but these are as rare as a pelican in the wilderness,
or a camel’s convoy caravan in the deserts of Arabia.
Add to this a few English sportsmen, with their stag
hounds, pointer dogs, and servants, and put themselves
and their bravery together, and one company of French
soldiers would put ten thousand of them to a disorderly
flight, to save their own carcases, leaving their ewes and
tups to feed the invaders!</p>

<p>The question may arise, where those people, who
inhabited this country at one period, have gone?
In America and Australia the most of them will be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
found. The Sutherland family and the nation had
no need of their services; hence they did not regard
their patriotism or loyalty, and disregarded their past
services. Sheep, bullocks, deer, and game, became
more valuable than men. Yet a remnant, or in
other words a <em>skeleton</em>, of them is to be found along the
sea shore, huddled together in motley groups upon barren
moors, among cliffs and precipices, in the most impoverished,
degraded, subjugated, slavish, spiritless, condition
that human beings could exist in. If this is really the
lady who has “Glory to God in the highest, peace on
earth, and good will to men,” in view, and who is so
religiously denouncing the American statute which
“denies the slave the sanctity of marriage, with all its
joys, rights, and obligations&mdash;which separates, at the
will of the master, the wife from the husband, the children
from the parents,” I would advise her in God’s name to
take a tour round the sea-skirts of Sutherland, her own
estate, beginning at Brora, then to Helmsdale, Portskerra,
Strathy, Farr, Tongue, Durness, Eddrachillis,
and Assynt, and learn the subjugated, degraded, impoverished,
uneducated condition of the spiritless people of
that sea-beaten coast, about two hundred miles in length,
and let her with similar zeal remonstrate with her husband,
that their condition is bettered; for the cure for
all their misery and want is lying unmolested in the fertile
valleys above, and all under his control; and to advise
his Grace, her husband, to be no longer guided by his
Ahitophel, Mr. Loch, but to discontinue his depopulating
schemes, which have separated many a wife from her
husband, never to meet&mdash;which caused many a premature
death, and that separated many sons and daughters,
never to see each other; and by all means to withdraw
that mandate of Mr. Loch, which forbids marriage on the
Sutherland estate, under pains and penalties of being
banished from the county; for it has already augmented
illegitimate connections and issues fifty per cent above
what such were a few years ago&mdash;before this unnatural,
ungodly law was put in force.</p>

<p>Let us see what the character of these ill-used people<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
was! General Stewart of Garth, in his “Sketches of the
Highlands” says: In the words of a general officer
by whom the 93rd Sutherlanders were once reviewed,
“They exhibit a perfect pattern of military discipline
and moral rectitude. In the case of such men disgraceful
punishment would be as unnecessary as it would be
pernicious.” “Indeed,” says the General, “so remote
was the idea of such a measure in regard to them, that
when punishments were to be inflicted on others, and the
troops in garrison assembled to witness their execution,
the presence of the Sutherland Highlanders was dispensed
with, the effects of terror as a check to crime
being in their case uncalled for, as examples of that
nature were not necessary for such honourable soldiers.
When the Sutherland Highlanders were stationed at the
Cape of Good Hope anxious to enjoy the advantages of
religious instruction agreeably to the tenets of their
national church, and there being no religious service in
the garrison except the customary one of reading prayers
to the soldiers on parade, the Sutherland men
formed themselves into a congregation, appointed
elders of their own number, engaged and paid a
stipend (collected among themselves) to a clergyman of
the Church of Scotland, and had divine service performed
agreeably to the ritual of the Established Church every
Sabbath, and prayer meetings through the week.”
This reverend gentleman, Mr. Thom, in a letter which
appeared in the <cite>Christian Herald</cite> of October, 1814,
writes thus: “When the 93rd Highlanders left Cape
Town last month, there were among them 156 members
of the church, including three elders and three deacons,
all of whom, so far as men can know the heart from the
life, were pious men. The regiment was certainly a
pattern of morality, and good behaviour to all other
corps. They read their Bibles and observed the Sabbath.
They saved their money to do good. 7000 rix dollars,
a sum equal to £1200, the non-commissioned officers
and privates saved for books, societies, and for the spread
of the Gospel, a sum unparalleled in any other corps in
the world, given in the short space of eighteen months.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
Their example had a general good effect on both the
colonists and the heathen. If ever apostolic days were
revived in modern times on earth, I certainly believe
some of those to have been granted to us in Africa.”
Another letter of a similar kind, addressed to the Committee
of the Edinburgh Gaelic School Society (fourth
annual report), says: “The 93rd Highlanders arrived
in England, when they immediately received orders to
proceed to North America; but before they re-embarked
the sum collected for your society was made up and remitted
to your treasurer, amounting to seventy-eight
pounds, sterling.” “In addition to this,” says the
noble-minded, immortal General, “such of them as had
parents and friends in Sutherland did not forget their
destitute condition, occasioned by the operation of the
<em>fire and faggot</em>, <em>mis</em>-improved state of the county.”
During the short period the regiment was quartered at
Plymouth, upwards of £500 was lodged in one banking-house,
to be remitted to Sutherland, exclusive of many
sums sent through the Post Office and by officers; some
of the sums exceeding £20 from an individual soldier.
Men like these do credit to the peasantry of a country.
“It must appear strange, and somewhat inconsistent,”
continues the General, “when the same men who are so
loud in their profession of an eager desire to promote and
preserve the religious and moral virtues of the people,
should so frequently take the lead in removing them from
where they imbibed principles which have attracted the
notice of Europe and of measures which lead to a deterioration,
placing families on patches of potato ground
as in Ireland, a system pregnant with degradation,
poverty, and disaffection.” It is only when parents and
heads of families in the Highlands are moral, happy, and
contented, that they can instil sound principles into their
children, who in their intercourse with the world may
become what the men of Sutherland have already been,
“an honourable example, worthy the imitation of all.”</p>

<p>I cannot help being grieved at my unavoidable
abbreviation of these heart-stirring and heart-warming
extracts, which should ornament every mantel-piece<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
and library in the Highlands of Scotland; but I could
refer to other authors of similar weight; among the
last (though not the least), Mr. Hugh Millar of the <cite>Witness</cite>,
in his “Sutherland as it was and is: or, How a country
can be ruined;” a work which should silence and put
to shame every vile, malignant calumniator of Highland
religion and moral virtue in bygone years, who in their
sophistical profession of a desire to promote the temporal
and spiritual welfare of the people, had their own sordid
cupidity and aggrandisement in view in all their unworthy
lucubrations.</p>

<p>At the commencement of the Russian war a
correspondent wrote as follows: “Your predictions
are making their appearance at last, great demands
are here for men to go to Russia, but they are not
to be found. It seems that the Secretary of War
has corresponded with all our Highland proprietors, to
raise as many men as they could for the Crimean war,
and ordered so many officers of rank to the Highlands to
assist the proprietors in doing so&mdash;but it has been a complete
failure as yet. The nobles advertised, by placards,
meetings of the people; these proclamations were attended
to, but when they came to understand what they
were about, in most cases the recruiting proprietors
and staff were saluted with the ominous cry of ‘Maa!
maa! boo! boo!’ imitating sheep and bullocks, and,
‘Send your deer, your roes, your rams, dogs, shepherds,
and gamekeepers to fight the Russians, they have never
done us any harm.’ The success of his Grace the Duke of
Sutherland was deplorable; I believe you would have
pitied the poor old man had you seen him.</p>

<p>“In my last letter I told you that his head commissioner,
Mr. Loch, and military officer, was in Sutherland
for the last six weeks, and failed in getting one man
to enlist; on getting these doleful tidings, the Duke himself
left London for Sutherland, arriving at Dunrobin
about ten days ago, and after presenting himself upon the
streets of Golspie and Brora, he called a meeting of the
male inhabitants of the parishes of Clyne, Rogart, and
Golspie; the meeting was well attended; upwards of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
400 were punctual at the hour; his Grace in his carriage,
with his military staff and factors appeared shortly after;
the people gave them a hearty cheer; his Grace took the
chair. Three or four clerks took their seats at the table,
and loosened down bulky packages of bank notes, and
spread out platefuls of glittering gold. The Duke addressed
the people very seriously, and entered upon the
necessity of going to war with Russia, and the danger of
allowing the Czar to have more power than what he holds
already; of his cruel, despotic reign in Russia, etc.;
likewise praising the Queen and her government, rulers
and nobles of Great Britain, who stood so much in need
of men to put and keep down the tyrant of Russia, and
foil him in his wicked schemes to take possession of
Turkey. In concluding his address, which was often
cheered, the Duke told the young able-bodied men that
his clerks were ready to take down the names of all those
willing to enlist, and everyone who would enlist in the
93rd Highlanders, that the clerk would give him, there
and then, £6 sterling; those who would rather enter any
other corps, would get £3, all from his own private purse,
independently of the government bounty. After advancing
many silly flattering decoyments, he sat down to
see the result, but there was no movement among the
people; after sitting for a long time looking at the clerks,
and they at him, at last his anxious looks at the people
assumed a somewhat indignant appearance, when he
suddenly rose up and asked what was the cause of their
non-attention to the proposals he made, but no reply;
it was the silence of the grave. Still standing, his Grace
suddenly asked the cause; but no reply; at last an old
man, leaning upon his staff, was observed moving towards
the Duke, and when he approached near enough, he
addressed his Grace something as follows: ‘I am sorry
for the response your Grace’s proposals are meeting here
to-day, so near the spot where your maternal grandmother,
by giving forty-eight hours’ notice, marshalled fifteen
hundred men to pick out of them the nine hundred she
required, but there is a cause for it, and a grievous cause,
and as your Grace demands to know it, I must tell you,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
as I see no one else are inclined in this assembly to do it.
Your Grace’s mother and predecessors applied to our
fathers for men upon former occasions, and our fathers
responded to their call; they have made liberal promises,
which neither them nor you performed; we are, we think,
a little wiser than our fathers, and we estimate your promises
of to-day at the value of theirs, besides you should
bear in mind that your predecessors and yourself expelled
us in a most cruel and unjust manner from the land which
our fathers held in lien from your family, for their sons,
brothers, cousins, and relations, which were handed over
to your parents to keep up their dignity, and to kill
the Americans, Turks, French, and the Irish; and these
lands are devoted now to rear dumb brute animals, which
you and your parents consider of far more value than men.
I do assure your Grace that it is the prevailing opinion
in this county, that should the Czar of Russia take possession
of Dunrobin Castle and of Stafford House next
term, that we could not expect worse treatment at his
hands, than we have experienced at the hands of your
family for the last fifty years. Your parents, yourself,
and your commissioners, have desolated the glens and
straths of Sutherland, where you should find hundreds,
yea, thousands of men to meet you, and respond cheerfully
to your call, had your parents and yourself kept faith
with them. How could your Grace expect to find men
where they are not, and the few of them which are to be
found among the rubbish or ruins of the county, has more
sense than to be decoyed by chaff to the field of slaughter;
but one comfort you have, though you cannot find men to
fight, you can supply those who will fight with plenty of
mutton, beef, and venison.’ The Duke rose up, put on
his hat, and left the field.”</p>

<p>Whether my correspondent added to the old man’s
reply to his Grace or not, I cannot say, but one thing is
evident, it was the very reply his Grace deserved.</p>

<p>I know for a certainty this to be the prevailing feeling
throughout the whole Highlands of Scotland, and who
should wonder at it? How many thousands of them who
served out their 21, 22, 25, and 26 years, fighting for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
British aristocracy, and on their return&mdash;wounded,
maimed, or worn out&mdash;to their own country, promising
themselves to spend the remainder of their days in peace,
and enjoying the blessings and comfort their fathers
enjoyed among their Highland, healthy, delightful hills,
but found to their grief, that their parents were expelled
from the country to make room for sheep, deer, and game,
the glens where they were born, desolate, and the abodes
which sheltered them at birth, and where they were
reared to manhood, burnt to the ground; and instead
of meeting the cheers, shaking-hands, hospitality, and
affections of fathers, mothers, brothers, sisters, and relations,
met with desolated glens, bleating of sheep, barking
of dogs; and if they should happen to rest their
worn-out frame upon the green sod which has grown upon
their father’s hearth, and a gamekeeper, factor, or water
bailiff, to come round, he would very unceremoniously
tell them to absent themselves as smart as they could,
and not to annoy the deer. No race on record has suffered
so much at the hands of those who should be their patrons,
and proved to be so tenacious of patriotism as the Celtic
race, but I assure you it has found its level now, and will
disappear soon altogether; and as soon as patriotism
shall disappear in any nation, so sure that nation’s glory is
tarnished, victories uncertain, her greatness diminished,
and decaying consumptive death will be the result. If
ever the old adage, which says, “Those whom the gods
determine to destroy, they first deprive them of reason,”
was verified, it was, and is, in the case of the British
aristocracy, and Highland proprietors in particular. I
am not so void of feeling as to blame the Duke of Sutherland,
his parents, or any other Highland absentee proprietor
for all the evil done in the land, but the evil was
done in their name, and under the authority they have
invested in wicked, cruel servants. For instance, the
only silly man who enlisted from among the great assembly
which his Grace addressed, was a married man, with
three of a family and his wife; it was generally believed
that his bread was baked for life, but no sooner was he
away to Fort George to join his regiment, than his place<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
of abode was pulled down, his wife and family turned out,
and only permitted to live in a hut, from which an old
female pauper was carried a few days before to the
churchyard; there the young family were sheltered,
and their names registered upon the poor roll for support;
his Grace could not be guilty of such low rascality as this,
yet he was told of it, but took no cognisance of those who
did it in his name. It is likewise said that this man got a
furlough of two weeks to see his wife and family before
going abroad, and that when the factor heard he was
coming, he ordered the ground officer of the parish of
Rogart, named MacLeod, to watch the soldier, and not
allow him to see nor speak to his wife, but in his (the
officer’s) presence. We had at the same time, in the
parish, an old bachelor of the name of John Macdonald,
who had three idiot sisters, whom he upheld, independent
of any source of relief; but a favourite of George, the
notorious factor, envied this poor bachelor’s farm, and
he was summoned to remove at next term. The poor
fellow petitioned his Grace and Loch, but to no purpose;
he was doomed to walk away on the term day, as the
factor told him, “to America, Glasgow, or to the devil if
he choosed.” Seeing he had no other alternative, two
days before the day of his removal he yoked his cart,
and got neighbours to help him to haul the three idiots
into it, and drove away with them to Dunrobin Castle.
When he came up to factor Gunn’s door, he capsized
them out upon the green, and wheeled about and went
away home. The three idiots finding themselves upon
the top of one another so sudden, they raised an inhuman-like
yell, fixed into one another to fight, and scratched,
yelled, and screeched so terrific that Mr. Gunn, his lady,
his daughters, and all the clerks and servants were soon
about them; but they hearkened to no reason, for they
had none themselves, but continued their fighting and
inharmonious music. Messenger after messenger was
sent after John, but of no use; at last the great Gunn
himself followed and overtook him, asked him how did
he come to leave his sisters in such a state? He replied,
“I kept them while I had a piece of land to support<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
them; you have taken that land from me, then take them
along with the land, and make of them what you can; I
must look out for myself, but I cannot carry them to the
labour market.” Gunn was in a fix, and had to give
John assurance that he would not be removed if he would
take his sisters, so John took them home, and has not been
molested as yet.</p>

<p>I have here beside me (in Canada) a respectable girl
of the name of Ann Murray, whose father was removed
during the time of the wholesale <em>faggot</em> removals, but got a
lot of a barren moor to cultivate. However barren-like it
was, he was raising a family of industrious young sons,
and by dint of hard labour and perseverance, they made
it a comfortable home; but the young sons one by one
left the country (and four of them are within two miles
of where I sit); the result was, that Ann was the only one
who remained with the parents. The mother, who had
an attack of palsy, was left entirely under Ann’s care
after the family left; and she took it so much to heart
that her daughter’s attention was required day and
night, until death put an end to her afflictions, after
twelve years’ suffering. Shortly after the mother’s
death, the father took ill, and was confined to bed for
nine months; and Ann’s labour re-commenced until his
decease. Though Ann Murray could be numbered among
the most dutiful of daughters, yet her incessant labour,
for a period of more than thirteen years, made visible
inroads upon her tender constitution; yet by the liberal
assistance of her brothers, who did not loose sight of her
and their parent (though upon a foreign strand), Ann
Murray kept the farm in the best of order, no doubt
expecting that she would be allowed to keep it after her
parent’s decease, but this was not in store for her; the
very day after her father’s funeral, the officer came to her
and told her that she was to be removed in a few weeks,
that the farm was let to another, and that Factor Gunn
wished to see her. She was at that time afflicted with
jaundice, and told the officer she could not undertake the
journey, which was only ten miles. Next day the officer
was at her again, more urgent than before, and made use<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
of extraordinary threats; so she had to go. When she
appeared before this Bashaw, he swore like a trooper, and
damned her soul, why she disobeyed his first summons;
she excused herself, trembling, that she was unwell;
another volley of oaths and threats met her response, and
told her to remove herself from the estate next week, for
her conduct; and with a threat, which well becomes a
Highland tyrant, not to take away, nor sell a single
article of furniture, implements of husbandry, cattle, or
crop; nothing was allowed but her own body clothes;
everything was to be handed over to her brother, who was
to have the farm. Seeing there was neither mercy nor
justice for her, she told him the crop, house, and every
other thing belonging to the farm, belonged to her and her
brothers in America, and that the brother to whom he
(the factor) intended to hand over the farm and effects
never helped her father or mother while in trouble; and
that she was determined that he should not enjoy what
she laboured for, and what her other brothers paid for.
She went and got the advice of a man of business, advertised
a sale, and sold off, in the face of threats of interdict,
and came to Canada, where she was warmly received by
brothers, sisters, and friends, now in Woodstock, and can
tell her tale better than I can. No one could think nor
believe that his Grace would ever countenance such doings
as these; but it was done in his name.</p>

<p>I have here within ten miles of me, Mr. William Ross,
once taxman of Achtomleeny, Sutherlandshire, who occupied
the most convenient farm to the principal deer-stalking
hills in the county. Often have the English
and Irish lords, connected in marriage with the Sutherlands,
dined and took their lunch at William Ross’s table,
and at his expense; and more than once passed the night
under his roof. Mr. Ross being so well acquainted
among the mountains and haunts of the deer, was often
engaged as a guide and instructor to these noblemen on
their deer-stalking and fishing excursions, and became a
real favourite with the Sutherland family, which enabled
him to erect superior buildings to the common rule, and
improve his farm in a superior style; so that his moun<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>tain-side
farm was nothing short of a Highland paradise.
But unfortunately for William, his nearest neighbour, one
Major Gilchrist, a sheep farmer, coveted Mr. Ross’s
vineyard, and tried many underhand schemes to secure
the place for himself, but in vain. Ross would hearken
to none of his proposals. But Ahab was a chief friend of
Factor Gunn; and William Ross got notice of removal.
Ross prepared a memorial to the first and late Duchess of
Sutherland, and placed it in her own hand. Her Grace
read it, instantly went into the factor’s office, and told
him that William Ross was not to be removed from Achtomleeny
while he lived; and wrote the same on the
petition, and handed it back to Ross, with a graceful
smile, saying, “You are now out of the reach of factors;
now, William, go home in peace.” William bowed, and
departed cheerfully; but the factor and ground-officer
followed close behind him, and while Ross was reading her
Grace’s deliverance, the officer, David Ross, came and
snapped the paper out of his hand, and ran to Factor
Gunn with it. Ross followed, but Gunn put it in his
pocket, saying, “William, you would need to give it to
me afterwards, at any rate, and I will keep it till I read
it, and then return it to you,” and with a tiger-like smile
on his face, said, “I believe you came good speed to-day,
and I am glad of it;” but William never got it in his hand
again. However, he was not molested during her Grace’s
life. Next year she paid a visit to Dunrobin Castle, when
Factor William Gunn advised Ross to apply to her for a
reduction of rent, under the mask of favouring him. He
did so, and it was granted cheerfully. Her Grace left
Dunrobin that year never to return; in the beginning of
the next spring she was carried back to Dunrobin a
corpse, and a few days after was interred in Dornoch.
William Ross was served with a summons of removal
from Achtomleeny, and he had nothing to show. He
petitioned the present Duke, and his commissioner, Mr.
Loch, and related the whole circumstances to them, but
to no avail, only he was told that Factor Gunn was
ordered to give him some other lot of land, which he did:
and having no other resource, William accepted of it to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
his loss; for between loss of cattle, building and repairing
houses, he was minus one hundred and fifty pounds sterling,
of his means, and substance, from the time he was
removed from Achtomleeny till he removed himself to
Canada. Besides, he had a written agreement or promise
for melioration or valuation for all the farm improvements
and house building at Achtomleeny, which was
valued by the family surveyor at £250. William was
always promised to get it, until they came to learn that
he was leaving for America, then they would not give him
a cent. William Ross left them with it to join his family
in Canada; but he can in his old age sit at as comfortable
a table, and sleep on as comfortable a bed, with greater
ease of mind and a clearer conscience, among his own
dutiful and affectionate children, than the tyrant factor
ever did, or ever will among his. I know as well as any
one can tell me, that this is but one or two cases out of
the thousand I could enumerate, where the liberality
and benevolence of his Grace, and of his parents, were
abused, and that to their patron’s loss. You see in the
above case that William was advised to plead for a
reduction of rent, so that the factor’s favourite, Ahab
Gilchrist, would have the benefit of Naboth Ross’s improvement,
and the reduction he got on his rent, which
would not be obtained otherwise.</p>

<p>The unhallowed crew of factors and officials, from the
highest to the lowest grade, employed by the family of
Sutherland, got the corrupt portion of the public press on
their side, to applaud their wicked doings and schemes, as
the only mode of improvement and civilisation in the
Highlands of Scotland. They have got what is still more
to be lamented, all the Established ministers, with few
exceptions, on their side; and in them they found faithful
auxiliaries in crushing the people. Any of them could
hold a whole congregation by the hair of their heads
over hell-fire, if they offered to resist the powers that be,
until they submitted. If a single individual resisted, he
was denounced from the pulpit, and considered afterwards
a dangerous man in the community; and he might
depart as quick as he could. Any man, or men, may<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
violate the laws of God, and violate the laws of heaven,
as often as he chooses; he is never heeded, and has nothing
to fear; but if he offends the Duke’s factor, the lowest
of his minions, or violates the least of their laws and regulations,
it is an unpardonable sin. The present Duke’s
mother was no doubt a liberal lady of many good parts,
and seemed to be much attached to the natives, but unfortunately
for them, she employed for her factors a vile,
unprincipled crew, who were their avowed enemies;
she would hearken to the complaints of the people, and
would write to the ministers of the Gospel to ascertain the
correctness of complaints, and the factor was justified,
however gross the outrage was that he committed&mdash;the
minister dined with the factor, and could not refuse to
favour him. The present Duke<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> is a simple, narrow-minded
gentleman, who concerns himself very little
even about his own pecuniary affairs; he entrusts his
whole affairs to his factors, and the people are enslaved
so much, that it is now considered the most foolish thing
a man can do to petition his Grace, whatever is done to
him, for it will go hard with the factor, or he will punish
and make an example of him to deter others.</p>

<p>To detail what I knew myself personally, and what I
have learned from others of their conduct, would, as I
said before, fill a volume. For instance:&mdash;When a
marriage in the family of Sutherland takes place, or the
birth of an heir, a feast is ordered for the Sutherland
people, consisting of whisky, porter, ale, and plenty of
eatables. The day of feasting and rejoicing is appointed,
and heralded throughout the country, and the people are
enjoined in marshal terms to assemble&mdash;barrels of raw
and adulterated whisky are forwarded to each parish,
some raw adulterated sugar, and that is all. Bonfires are
to be prepared on the tops of the highest mountains. The
poorest of the poor are warned by family officers to carry
the materials, consisting of peats and tar barrels, upon
their backs; the scene is lamentable to see groups of these
wretched, half-clad and ill-shod, climbing up these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
mountains with their loads; however, the work must be
done, there is no denial, the evening of rejoicing is arrived,
and the people are assembled at their different clachans.
The barrels of whisky are taken out to the open field,
poured into large tubs, a good amount of abominable-looking
sugar is mixed with it, and a sturdy favourite
is employed to stir it about with a flail handle, or some
long cudgel&mdash;all sorts of drinking implements are produced,
tumblers, bowls, ladles, and tin jugs. Bagpipers
are set up with great glee. In the absence of the factor,
the animal called the ground officer, and in some instances
the parish minister, will open the jollification, and show
an example to the people how to deal with this coarse
beverage. After the first round, the respectable portion
of the people will depart, or retire to an inn, where they
can enjoy themselves; but the <em>drouthies</em>, and ignorant
youthful, will keep the field of revelling until tearing of
clothes and faces comes to be the rule; fists and cudgels
supplant jugs and ladles, and this will continue until king
Bacchus enters the field and hushes the most heroic
brawlers and the most ferocious combatants to sound
snoring on the field of rejoicing, where many of them
enter into contracts with death, from which they could
never extricate themselves. With the co-operation and
assistance of factors, ministers, and editors, a most
flourishing account is sent to the world, and to the
absentee family in London, who knows nothing about how
the affair was conducted. The world will say how happy
must the people be who live under such good and noble,
liberal-minded patrons; and the patrons themselves are
so highly-pleased with the report that, however extraordinary
the bill that comes to them on the rent day, in
place of money, for roast beef and mutton, bread and
cheese, London porter and Edinburgh ale, which was
never bought, nor tasted by the people, they will consider
their commissioners used great economy; no cognizance
is taken, the bill is accepted, and discharged, the people
are deceived, and the proprietors injured.</p>

</div>

<p>For his action in connection with the Sutherland
Clearances, Patrick Sellar was placed on trial at a sitting
of the Circuit Court at Inverness in 1816. The bench
was occupied by Lord Pitmilly. We give the indictment,
defences, judge’s summing up, and other particulars,
but omit the evidence, as no authentic record thereof is
available.</p>


<h3>THE INDICTMENT.</h3>

<p>PATRICK SELLAR, now or lately residing at Culmaily,
in the parish of Golspie, and shire of Sutherland,
and under factor for the Most Noble the Marquis
and Marchioness of Stafford. You are indicted and
accused, at the instance of Archibald Colquhoun of Killermont,
his Majesty’s Advocate for his Majesty’s interest:
That albeit, by the laws of this and of every other well-governed
realm, culpable homicide, as also oppression and
real injury, more particularly the wickedly and
maliciously setting on fire and burning, or causing and
procuring to be set on fire and burnt, a great extent of
heath and pasture, on which a number of small tenants
and other poor persons maintain their cattle, to the
great injury and distress of the said persons; the violently
turning, or causing and procuring to be turned out of
their habitations, a number of the said tenants and other
poor people, especially aged, infirm, and impotent persons
and pregnant women, and cruelly depriving them of all
cover or shelter, to their great distress, and the imminent
danger of their lives; the wickedly and
maliciously setting on fire, burning, pulling down, and
demolishing, or causing and procuring to be set on fire,
burnt, pulled down, and demolishing, the dwelling-houses,
barns, kilns, mills, and other buildings, lawfully<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
occupied by the said persons, whereby they themselves
are turned out, without cover or shelter, as aforesaid,
and the greater part of their different crops is lost and
destroyed, from the want of the usual and necessary accommodation
for securing and manufacturing the same;
and the wantonly setting on fire, burning, and otherwise
destroying, or causing and procuring to be set on fire,
burnt, and otherwise destroyed, growing corn, timber,
furniture, money, and other effects, the property, or in the
lawful possession of the said tenants and other poor
persons, are crimes of a heinous nature, and severely
punishable. Yet true it is, and of verity, that you the
said Patrick Sellar are guilty of the said crimes, or of one
or more of them, actor, or art in part; in so far as you
the said Patrick Sellar did, on the 15th day of March,
1814, or on one or other of the days of that month, or of
April and May immediately following, and on many occasions
during the said months of March, April and May,
wickedly and maliciously set on fire and burn, or cause
and procure John Dryden and John M’Kay, both at that
time shepherds in your service, to set on fire and burn a
great extent of heath and pasture, many miles in length
and breadth, situate in the heights of the parishes of Farr
and Kildonan, in the county of Sutherland, and in particular
in the lands of Ravigill, Rhiphail, Rhiloisk, Rossal,
Rhimsdale, Garvault, Truderskaig, and Dalcharrel,
whereby many of the tenants and others in the lands
aforesaid were deprived of pasturage for their cattle, and
in consequence thereof reduced to great distress and poverty;
and many of them were obliged to feed their cattle
with the potatoes intended for the use of their families,
and with their seed corn; particularly William Gordon,
James M’Kay, Hugh Grant, and Donald M’Kay, all then
tenants in Rhiloisk aforesaid; John Gordon and Hugh
M’Beath, then tenants in Rhimsdale aforesaid; Donald
M’Beath, then tenant in Rhiphail aforesaid; Murdo
M’Kay and John M’Kay, then tenants in Truderskaig
aforesaid. And further, you the said Patrick Sellar did,
upon the 13th day of June, 1814, or on one or other of the
days of that month, or of May immediately preceding,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
or of July immediately following, together with four or
more persons, your assistants, proceed to the district of
country above-mentioned, and did, then and there,
violently turn, or cause or procure to be turned out of
their habitations, a number of the tenants and poor
people dwelling there; and particularly Donald M’Kay,
a feeble old man of the age of four-score years or thereby,
then residing in Rhiloisk aforesaid; who, upon being so
turned out, not being able to travel to the nearest inhabited
place, lay for several days and nights thereafter
in the woods in the vicinity, without cover or shelter, to
his great distress, and to the danger of his life. As also,
Barbara M’Kay, wife of John M’Kay, then tenant in
Ravigill aforesaid, who was at the time pregnant, and was
moreover confined to her bed in consequence of being
severely hurt and bruised by a fall; and you the said
Patrick Sellar did, then and there, notwithstanding the
entreaties of the said John M’Kay, give orders that the
said Barbara M’Kay should be instantly turned out,
whatever the consequences might be, saying, That you
would have the house pulled about her ears; and the
said John M’Kay was accordingly compelled, with the
assistance of some women and neighbours to lift his said
wife from her bed, and carry her nearly a mile across the
country to the imminent danger of her life: As also,
time last above-mentioned, you the said Patrick Sellar
did forcibly turn out, or cause and procure your assistants
aforesaid, to turn out, of his bed and dwelling, in Garvault
aforesaid, Donald Munro, a young lad, who lay sick
in bed at the time. And further, you the said Patrick
Sellar, did time aforesaid, wickedly and maliciously set on
fire, burn, pull down, and demolish, or cause and procure
your assistants aforesaid to set on fire, burn, pull down,
and demolish a great number of the dwelling-houses,
barns, kilns, mills, and other buildings, lawfully occupied
by the tenants and other inhabitants in the said district
of country; and in particular, the houses, barns, kilns,
mills, lawfully occupied by the above-mentioned William
Gordon, James M’Kay, Hugh Grant, in Rhiloisk aforesaid;
and John Gordon in Rhimsdale aforesaid; As<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
also, the barns and kilns in Rhiphail aforesaid, lawfully
occupied by Alexander Manson, John M’Kay, and others,
then tenants or residenters there; the barns and kilns
in Ravigill aforesaid, lawfully occupied by John M’Kay,
Murdo M’Kay, and others, then tenants there; and the
barns and kilns in Garvault aforesaid, lawfully occupied
by William Nicol and John Monro, then tenants there;
As also, the house and barn in Ravigill aforesaid, lawfully
occupied by Barbara M’Kay, an infirm old widow,
nearly fourscore years of age, and who was obliged to
sell three of her five cattle at an under value, in order to
support herself, her crop being destroyed from the want
of her barn: As also, the greater part of the houses,
barns, kilns, mills, and other buildings in the whole district
of country above mentioned, was, time aforesaid,
maliciously set on fire, burnt, pulled down, and demolished,
by you, the said Patrick Sellar, or by your
assistance or by your orders, whereby the inhabitants
and lawful occupiers thereof were turned out, without
cover or shelter; and the greater part of their different
crops was lost and destroyed from want of the usual and
necessary accommodation for securing and manufacturing
the same; and especially the lawful occupiers of the
barns, kilns, mills, and other buildings particularly
above mentioned, to have been set on fire and destroyed
as aforesaid, did sustain great loss in their crops, from
being thus deprived of the means of securing and manufacturing
the same. And further, you, the said Patrick
Sellar, did, time aforesaid, culpably kill Donald M’Beath,
father to Hugh M’Beath, then tenant in Rhimsdale
aforesaid, by unroofing and pulling down, or causing to
be unroofed and pulled down, the whole house in Rhimsdale
aforesaid, where the said Donald M’Beath was then
lying on his sick bed, saving only a small space of roof,
to the extent of five or six yards, whereby the said Donald
M’Beath was exposed, in a cold and comfortless situation,
without cover or shelter, to the weather; and he, the said
Donald M’Beath, in consequence of being so exposed,
never spoke a word more, but languished and died about
eight days thereafter, and was thereby culpably killed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
by you, the said Patrick Sellar: Or otherwise, you, the
said Patrick Sellar, did, time and place aforesaid, cruelly
expose the said Donald M’Beath to the weather, without
cover or shelter, by pulling down and unroofing, or caused
to be pulled down and unroofed, the greater part of the
house where he then lay sick in bed, to his great distress,
and the imminent danger of his life; and this you, the
said Patrick Sellar, did, notwithstanding the entreaties
of the said Hugh M’Beath, and others, you saying, in a
rage, when it was proposed that the said Donald M’Beath
should remain, “The devil a man of them, sick or well,
shall be permitted to remain,” or words to that effect.
And further, you, the said Patrick Sellar, did, time aforesaid,
wickedly and maliciously set on fire, burn, and demolish,
or cause and procure your assistants to set on fire,
burn, and demolish, the dwelling-house, barn, kiln, sheep-cot,
and other building then lawfully occupied by William
Chisholm in Badinloskin, in the parish of Farr aforesaid,
although you knew that Margaret M’Kay, a very old
woman of the age of 90 years, less or more, and who had
been bed-ridden for years, was at that time within the
said house; and this you did, notwithstanding you were
told that the said old woman could not be removed without
imminent danger to her life; and the flames having
approached the bed whereon the said Margaret M’Kay
lay, she shrieked aloud in Gaelic, “<span lang="gd" xml:lang="gd">O’n teine</span>,” that is to
say, “O the fire,” or words to that effect; and was forthwith
carried out by her daughter, Janet M’Kay, and
placed in a small bothy, and the blanket in which she
was wrapped was burnt in several places, and the said
Margaret M’Kay never spoke a word thereafter, but
remained insensible from that hour, and died in about
five days thereafter, in consequence of the fright and
alarm; and, in particular, in consequence of her removal,
as aforesaid, from her bed into a cold and uncomfortable
place, unfit for the habitation of any human
being; and the said Margaret M’Kay was thereby culpably
killed by you, the said Patrick Sellar; or otherwise,
you, the said Patrick Sellar, did, time and place aforesaid,
cruelly turn, or cause to be turned, out of her bed and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
dwelling-place, the said Margaret Mackay, by setting on
fire, burning, and demolishing, or causing and procuring
to be set on fire, burnt, and demolished, the said house and
other buildings, in manner above mentioned, to her great
distress, and the imminent danger of her life. And farther,
all the persons whose houses, barns, kilns, mills,
and other buildings, were burnt and destroyed, or caused
and procured to be burnt and destroyed by you, the said
Patrick Sellar, all as above described, did sustain great
loss in their moss wood, and other timber, which was
broken and demolished, and destroyed by fire and otherwise,
at the same time, and in the same manner, with the
buildings as aforesaid; and also in their furniture and
other effects, all their lawful property, or in their lawful
possession at the time: And, in particular, the said
Barbara M’Kay in Ravigill, aforesaid, lost her door and
door-posts, and timber of her house and barn, her meal-chest,
and several articles of furniture, all her property,
or in her lawful possession, which were then and there
destroyed, or caused to be destroyed, by you, the said
Patrick Sellar, as aforesaid; and the greatest part of the
furniture, and timber belonging to the said William
Chisholm, together with three pounds in bank notes, and
a ridge of growing corn, all the property, or in the lawful
possession of the said William Chisholm, in Badinloskin,
aforesaid, were then and there destroyed by fire, and
otherwise, by you, the said Patrick Sellar. And you, the
said Patrick Sellar, having been apprehended and taken
before Mr. Robert Mackid, Sheriff-Substitute of Sutherland,
did, in his presence, at Dornoch, on the 31st day of
May, 1815, emit and subscribe a declaration; which
declaration, together with a paper entitled “Notice
given to the Strathnaver tenants, 15 Dec., 1813,” being
to be used in evidence against you, at your trial, will be
lodged in due time in the hands of the Clerk of the Circuit
Court of Justiciary, before which you are to be tried, that
you may have an opportunity of seeing the same: at
least, time and places above-mentioned, the said heath
and pasture, was wickedly and maliciously set on fire
and burnt, or caused and procured to be set on fire and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
burnt, to the great injury and distress of the said tenants
and others; and the said persons were violently turned,
or caused and procured to be turned, out of their habitations,
and deprived of all cover and shelter, to their great
distress, and the imminent danger of their lives; and the
said Donald M’Beath and Margaret M’Kay were culpably
killed in manner above mentioned, or were cruelly turned
out of their habitations as aforesaid; and the said
dwelling-houses, barns, kilns, mills, and other buildings,
lawfully inhabited and occupied by the said persons, were
maliciously set on fire, burnt, pulled down, and demolished,
or were caused and procured to be set on fire,
burnt, pulled down, and demolished, and the inhabitants
and lawful occupiers thereof turned out as aforesaid;
and the greater part of their different crops was lost or
destroyed, from want of the usual and necessary accommodation
for securing and manufacturing the same;
and the growing corn, timber, furniture, money, and other
effects, the property, or in the lawful possession, of the
said persons, were wantonly set on fire, burnt, and otherwise
destroyed or caused and procured to be set on fire,
burnt, and otherwise destroyed: And you, the said
Patrick Sellar, are guilty of the said crimes, or of one
or more of them, actor, or art and part. All which, or
part thereof, being found proven by the verdict of an
assize, before the Lord Justice-General, the Lord Justice-Clerk,
and Lords Commissioners of Justiciary, in a Circuit
Court of Justiciary to be holden by them, or by any
one or more of their number, within the burgh of Inverness,
in the month of April, in this present year, 1816,
you, the said Patrick Sellar, ought to be punished with the
pains of law, to deter others from committing the like
crimes in all time coming.</p>

H. HOME DRUMMOND, <i>A.D.</i>
</p>

<p>Mr Sellar, having pleaded <span class="smcap lowercase">NOT GUILTY</span>, the following
defences were read:&mdash;“<i>First</i>, The panel objects to the
relevancy of various parts of the libel. <i>Second</i>, In so
far as the libel is relevant, the panel denies its truth; the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
whole of the charges are utterly false, in so much so, that
the Prosecutor is not only unable to bring any sufficient
evidence in support of his own accusations, but the panel
will bring positive proof <em>against</em> them. The panel will
prove, that the ejectments which have given rise to this
trial, were done in due order of law, and, under the warrants
of the proper Judge, issued on regular process.
Farther, he will prove that great indulgence was shown
to the tenants, even after they had resisted the regular
decrees of the Judge; that nothing was done on his part,
or with his knowledge or approval, either cruel, oppressive
or illegal. That he committed no acts of homicide;
and, on the whole, he will prove, that throughout every
part of this affair, he (the panel) has been the victim, not
only of the most unfounded local prejudices, but of long
continued and active defamation, on the part of certain
persons, who have made it their business to traduce the
whole system of improvements introduced into the Sutherland
estate, and to vilify the panel, by whom, they have
been pleased to suppose, that these improvements have
been partly conducted. He rejoices, however, in the first
opportunity, which has now been afforded to him, of
meeting these calumnies and prepossessions in a Court of
Justice, and relying, as he does, with implicit confidence
on the candour and dispassionate attention of a British
jury, he has no doubt whatever of being able to establish
his complete innocence of all the charges now brought
against him.</p>

<span class="sigindent">“H. COCKBURN.</span><br />
<span class="sigindent">“PAT. ROBERTSON.”</span><br />
</p>

<p>Mr. Robertson opened the case on the part of the panel.
The object of addressing the court at this time was to
state such observations as occurred on the relevancy of
the indictment, and to give a general view of the line of
defence. On the former, he remarked, that various objections
did occur to the relevancy of the charges, par<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>ticularly
to the second and fourth branches of the indictment.
With these, however, he did not mean to trouble
the Court, as Mr. Sellar was so conscious of his innocence,
that he courted investigation, being unwilling that any
part of his conduct should be left uninvestigated. No
objection was, therefore, made to the relevancy of any
part of the indictment, so far as it charged any specific
crime against which the panel might be prepared to defend
himself. But, certainly, he did object to those
parts of it which contained general charges, of destroying
“a number of houses,” injuring “a number of tenants,”
&amp;c., unless these were understood merely as introductory
to the specific crimes mentioned. He also objected
to the last charge, if meant as anything more than
matter of mere aggravation.</p>

<p>On the merits, he gave a short sketch of the causes
which gave rise to the present trial,&mdash;alluded to the clamour
which had been raised in the country&mdash;the prejudices
of the people,&mdash;the disgraceful publications in a newspaper
called the <cite>Military Register</cite>, and the pains which
had been taken to circulate these false and mischievous
papers through Sutherland and the adjacent counties.
The general line of defence he stated to be, That, as to the
first charge, of heath-burning, this was done with the
express consent of the tenantry, and, as could be proved,
to their positive advantage. As to the removings, the
defence was quite clear. The lands mentioned in the
indictment were advertised to be set on the 5th of December,
1813, at the Inn of Golspie, and Mr. Sellar was preferred
as the highest offerer. Before Whitsunday, 1814,
he brought regular actions of removing, and it was not
until after he had obtained decrees in these actions,
charged the whole of the tenants to remove, and taken out
precepts of ejection against them, that they were, in the
month of June, actually removed from their lawless and
violent possession. These facts were established by the
decrees and precepts in the hands of the Clerk of Court.
As to the demolition of the houses, no houses were pulled
down till after the ejections had been completed, and the
property had become Mr. Sellar’s. No furniture was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
destroyed by him, or by his orders,&mdash;no unnecessary
violence was used, nor any cruelty exercised, but everything
was done in due order of law, and without oppression
of any kind. The charges of culpable homicide were
quite out of the question, and Mr. Sellar defied the Public
Prosecutor to prove them. Upon the whole, it was not
doubted, that if truth and justice were to prevail over
malice and conspiracy, Mr. Sellar would obtain an honourable
and triumphant acquittal.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The Advocate-Depute having here stated that he did
not mean to insist on any charges, excepting those which
were specially and articulately mentioned in the indictment,
Lord Pitmilly <span class="lock">said:&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“It would be improper for me to enter at present into
the origin of the prosecution, or the nature of the defences.
Neither shall I say anything of the publications which
have been alluded to, except that they appear to be of the
most contemptible nature, and the only prejudice which
I can entertain is the other way; that is, against the
cause requiring such aid. I have no doubt as to the
relevancy of the libel.”</p></div>

<p>The jury was composed of the following <span class="lock">gentlemen:&mdash;</span></p>

<li>James Fraser, of Belladrum.</li>
<li>William Fraser, of Culbockie.</li>
<li>William Mackintosh, of Balnaspeck.</li>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span></p>

<p>Evidence for the prosecution and for the defence
having been led at considerable length,</p>

<p>Mr. Drummond addressed the jury on the part of the
Crown. He stated that he gave up all the charges
except the one which regarded the ejections from
the barns, and that of real injury in the case of
the old woman at Badinloskin. He certainly did
not think the evidence in this case last was sufficient
to establish culpable homicide; but he argued,
that the circumstances proved were sufficient to
authorise the jury in finding a verdict of guilty to the
extent of an injury, as she had been removed at the risk
of her life, which he maintained to be contrary to law.
As to the barns, he contended that the conduct of Mr.
Sellar was irregular and illegal, and consequently oppressive,
the outgoing tenants being entitled, by the custom
of Sutherland, to retain them as long as the arable
land.</p>

<p>Mr. Gordon addressed the jury on the part of the panel,
and replied to the arguments used on behalf of the prosecution.
He entered at great length into the history and
objects of the prosecution; the preconcerted plan on
which certain persons had instigated the people of Strathnaver
to complain at first, and to persist afterwards; the
views they entertained of successfully opposing the improvements
of Sutherland, by affecting the noble persons
to whom the property belonged, through the sides of Mr.
Sellar, as a convenient medium of succeeding; the disgraceful
measures to which these persons had resorted,
with a view to affect the channels of justice, the
impartiality of jurymen, and the purity of evidence. He
attacked the measures and conduct of Mr. Mackid in the
most pointed terms; exposed the characters of the evidence
of Chisholm and others, and dwelt in the clear
evidence of the total innocence of Mr. Sellar, and on the
points of law which applied to the particular charges as
criminal charges, at considerable length, and with reference
to various law authorities; and finally, concluded
by maintaining to the jury, that this was not merely the
trial of Mr. Sellar, but, in truth, a conflict between the law<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
of the land and a resistance to that law: That the question
at issue involved the future fate and progress of
agricultural, and even moral improvements, in the county
of Sutherland; that (though certainly not so intended
by the Public Prosecutor, whose conduct throughout
has been candid, correct, and liberal), it was nevertheless,
in substance, and in fact, a trial of strength between the
abettors of anarchy and misrule, and the magistracy, as
well as the laws of this country.</p>

<p>Lord Pitmilly, after having stated the law as applicable
to this case, summed up the evidence in a very clear and
able manner. His lordship stated, that it was unnecessary
for the jury to consider any of the charges, excepting
the one in regard to the old woman at Badinloskin. As to
the first, there could be no doubt of the practice in the
country, of retaining these barns till the crops would be
threshed out; neither could it be doubted, that Mr. Sellar
had not left the whole of the barns for the use of the outgoing
tenants, and in consequence of this, the tenants
suffered damage. But <em>in point of law</em>, as the Court of
Session had decided in a similar question, Mr. Sellar was
not bound by any such practice, but was entitled to proceed
in the ejections. In regard to the injury charged to
have been done to Margaret M’Kay, his Lordship directed
the attention of the jury to the evidence of Chisholm.
This witness, although contradicted in some particulars
by his wife, was confirmed by John M’Kay, whose testimony
his Lordship also laid before them. On the other
hand, he brought under their view, the evidence of Sutherland,
Fraser, and Burns, and stated that it was the duty of
the Jury to balance betwixt these two sets of witnesses.
His Lordship also said, that if the jury were at all at a loss
on this part of the case, they ought to take into view
the character of the accused; for this was always of
importance in balancing contradictory testimony. Now
here there was, in the <i>first</i> place, real evidence, from the
conduct of Mr. Sellar, in regard to the sick, for this, in
several instances, had been proved to be most humane.
And <i>secondly</i>, there were the letters of Sir George Abercromby,
Mr. Brodie, and Mr. Fenton, which, <em>although not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
evidence</em>,<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> must have some weight with the jury; and
there were the testimonies of Mr. Gilzean and Sir Archibald
Dunbar&mdash;all establishing Mr. Sellar’s humanity of
disposition.</p>

<p>The jury having retired for a quarter of an hour, returned
a <i>viva voce</i> verdict, unanimously finding Mr. Sellar
<span class="smcap lowercase">NOT GUILTY</span>.</p>

<p>Lord Pitmilly observed that his opinion completely
concurred with that of the jury, and in dismissing them
after so long a trial, he was happy to say they had paid the
most patient attention to the case, and had returned a
verdict satisfactory to the Court.</p>

<p>The verdict having been recorded,</p>

<p>The Advocate-Depute declared that he thought it fair
to the panel, and that it would be satisfactory to the jury,
to state his conviction, that if those witnesses who were
rejected on account of errors in their designations, had
been examined, the result of the trial would have been
the same.</p>

<p>Lord Pitmilly then addressed Mr. Sellar.</p>

<p>His Lordship said, “Mr. Sellar, it is now my duty to
dismiss you from the bar; and you have the satisfaction
of thinking, that you are discharged by the unanimous
opinion of the jury and the Court. I am sure that, although
your feelings must have been agitated, you cannot
regret that this trial took place, and I am hopeful it will
have due effect on the minds of the country, which have
been so much, and so improperly agitated.”</p>

<p>The Court then pronounced an interlocutor, in respect
of the verdict of the assize, assoilzieing the panel <i>simpliciter</i>,
and dismissing him from the bar.</p>

<p>The trial lasted from ten o’clock on Tuesday till one
o’clock on Wednesday morning, and the Court-room was
crowded to excess.</p>

<h3>GLENCALVIE.</h3>

<p>Great cruelties were perpetrated at Glencalvie, Ross-shire,
where the evicted had to retire into the parish
churchyard. There for more than a week they found the
only shelter obtainable in their native land. No one dared
to succour them, under a threat of receiving similar treatment
to those whose hard fate had driven them thus
among the tombs. Many of them, indeed, wished that
their lot had landed them under the sod with their ancestors
and friends, rather than be treated and driven out of
house and home in such a ruthless manner. A special
commissioner sent down by the London <cite>Times</cite> describes
the circumstances as <span class="lock">follows:&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="dateline">
<span class="smcap">Ardgay, near Tain, Ross-shire</span>,<br />
<span class="date"><i>15th May, 1845</i>.</span><br />
</p>

<p>Those who remember the misery and destitution to
which large masses of the population were thrown by the
systematic “Clearances” (as they are here called) carried
on in Sutherlandshire some 20 years ago, under the direction
and on the estate of the late Marchioness of Stafford&mdash;those
who have not forgotten to what an extent the
ancient ties which bound clansmen to their chiefs were
then torn asunder&mdash;will regret to learn the heartless
scourge with all its sequences of misery, of destitution, and
of crime, is again being resorted to in Ross-shire.
Amongst an imaginative people like the Highlanders,
who, poetic from dwelling amongst wild and romantic
scenery, shut out from the world and clinging to the
traditions of the past, it requires little, with fair treatment,
to make them almost idolise their heritor. They
would spend the last drop of their blood in his service.
But this feeling of respectful attachment to the landowners,
which money cannot buy, is fast passing away.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
This change is not without cause; and perhaps if the
dark deeds of calculating “feelosophy” transacted
through the instrumentality of factors in some of these
lonely glens; if the almost inconceivable misery and
hopeless destitution in which, for the expected acquisition
of a few pounds, hundreds of peaceable and generally
industrious and contented peasants are driven out from
the means of self-support, to become wanderers and
starving beggars, and in which a brave and valuable
population is destroyed&mdash;are exposed to the gaze of the
world, general indignation and disgust may effect what
moral obligations and humanity cannot. One of these
clearances is about to take place in the parish of Kincardine,
from which I now write; and throughout the whole
district it has created the strongest feeling of
indignation.</p>

<p>This parish is divided into two districts each of great
extent; one is called the parliamentary district of
Croick. The length of this district is about 20 miles,
with a breadth of from 10 to 15 miles. It extends
amongst the most remote and unfrequented parts of
the country, consisting chiefly of hills of heather and rock,
peopled only in a few straths and glens. This district
was formerly thickly peopled; but one of those clearances
many years ago nearly swept away the population,
and now the whole number of its inhabitants amounts,
I am told, to only 370 souls. These are divided into three
straths or glens, and live in a strath called Amatnatua,
another strath called Greenyard, and in Glencalvie. It
is the inhabitants of Glencalvie, in number 90 people,
whose turn it is now to be turned out of their homes, all
at once, the aged and the helpless as well as the young and
strong; nearly the whole of them without hope or prospect
for the future. The proprietor of this glen is Major
Charles Robertson of Kindeace, who is at present out
with his regiment in Australia; and his factor or steward
who acts for him in his absence is Mr. James Gillanders of
Highfield Cottage, near Dingwall. Glencalvie is situated
about 25 miles from Tain, eastward. Bleak rough hills,
whose surface are almost all rock and heather, closed in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
on all sides, leaving in the valley a gentle declivity of
arable land of a very poor description, dotted over by
cairns of stone and rock, not, at the utmost computation,
of more than 15 to 20 acres in extent. For this piece of
indifferent land with a right of pasturage on the hills
impinging upon it&mdash;and on which, if it were not a fact
that sheep do live, you would not credit that they could
live, so entirely does it seem void of vegetation, beyond
the brown heather, whilst its rocky nature makes it
dangerous and impossible even for a sheep walk&mdash;the
almost increditable rent of £55 10s. has been paid. I am
convinced that for the same land no farmer in England
would give £15 at the utmost.</p>

<p>Even respectable farmers here say they do not know
how the people raise the rent for it. Potatoes and barley
were grown in the valley, and some sheep and a few
black cattle find provender amongst the heather.
Eighteen families have each a cottage in the valley;
they have always paid their rent punctually, and they
have contrived to support themselves in all ordinary
seasons. They have no poor on the poor roll, and they
help one another over the winter. I am told that not an
inhabitant of this valley has been charged with any
offence for years back. During the war it furnished
many soldiers; and an old pensioner, 82 years of age,
who has served in India, is now dying in one of these
cottages, where he was born. For the convenience of the
proprietor, some ten years ago, four of the principal
tenants became bound for the rest, to collect all the rents
and pay the whole in one sum.</p>

<p>The clearance of this valley, having attracted much
notice, has been thoroughly enquired into, and a kind of
defence has been entered upon respecting it, which I
am told has been forwarded to the Lord Advocate.
Through the politeness of Mr. Mackenzie, writer, Tain, I
have been favoured with a copy of it. The only explanation
or defence of the clearance, that I can find in it, is
that shortly after Mr. Gillanders assumed the management
of Major Robertson’s estate, he found that it became
absolutely necessary to adopt a different system,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
in regard to the lands of Glencalvie, “from that hitherto
pursued.”</p>

<p>The “different system” as it appears was to turn the
barley and potato grounds into a sheep walk, and the
“absolute necessity” for it is an alleged increase of rent.</p>

<p>It was accordingly, in 1843, attempted to serve summonses
of removal upon the tenants. They were in no
arrears of rent, they had no burdens in poor; for 500
years their fathers had peaceably occupied the glen, and
the people were naturally indignant. Who can be surprised
that, on the constables going amongst them with
the summonses, they acted in a manner which, while it
showed their excitement, not the less evinced their wish
to avoid breaking the law? The women met the constables
beyond the boundaries, over the river, and seized
the hand of the one who held the notices; whilst some
held it out by the wrist, others held a live coal to the
papers and set fire to them. They were afraid of being
charged with destroying the notices, and they sought
thus to evade the consequences. This act of resistance
on their part has been made the most of. One of the men
told me, hearing they were to be turned out because
they did not pay rent enough, that they offered to pay
£15 a year more, and afterwards to pay as much rent as
any other man would give for the place. The following
year (1844), however, the four chief tenants were decoyed
to Tain, under the assurance that Mr. Gillanders
was going to settle with them, they believing that their
holdings were to be continued to them. The notices were
then, as they say, in a treacherous and tricky manner,
served upon them, however. Having been served, “a
decreet of removal” was obtained against them, under
which, of course, if they refused to turn out they would be
put out by force. Finding themselves in this position,
they entered into an arrangement with Mr. Gillanders,
in which after several propositions on either side, it was
agreed that they should remain until the 12th of May,
to give them time to provide themselves with holdings
elsewhere, Mr. Gillanders agreeing to pay them £100 on
quitting, and to take their stock on at a valuation. They<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
were also to have liberty to carry away the timber of their
houses, which was really worthless, except for firewood.
On their part they agreed to leave peaceably, and not to
lay down any crop. Beyond the excessive harshness of
removing the people at all, it is but right to say that the
mode of proceeding in the removal hitherto has been temperate
and considerate.</p>

<p>Two respectable farmers became bound for the people
that they would carry out their part of the agreement,
and the time of removal has since been extended to the
25th of this month. In the defence got up for this proceeding
it is stated that all have been provided for; this
is not only not the case, but seems to be intentionally
deceptive. In speaking of all, the four principal tenants
only are meant; for, according to the factor, these were
all he had to do with; but this is not the case even in
regard to the four principal tenants. Two only, a father
and son, have got a piece of black moor, near Tain, 25
miles off, without any house or shed on it, out of which
they hope to obtain subsistence. For this they are to
pay £1 rent for 7 acres the first year; £2 for the second
year; and £3 for a continuation. Another old man with
a family has got a house and a small lot of land in Edderton,
about 20 miles off. These three, the whole who have
obtained places where they may hope to make a living.
The old pensioner, if removing does not kill him, has obtained
for himself and family, and for his son’s family, a
house at a rent of £3 or £4, some ten miles off, without
any land or means of subsistence attached to it. This old
soldier has been offered 2s. a week by the factor to support
him while he lived. He was one of the four principal
tenants bound for the rent; and he indignantly refused
to be kept as a pauper.</p>

<p>A widow with four children, two imbecile, has obtained
two small apartments in a bothy or turf hut near Bonar
Bridge, for which she is to pay £2 rent, without any land
or means of subsistence. Another, a man with a wife and
four children, has got an apartment at Bonar Bridge, at
£1 rent. He goes there quite destitute, without means of
living. Six only of eighteen households, therefore, have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
been able to obtain places in which to put their heads;
and of these, three only have any means of subsistence
before them. The rest are hopeless and helpless. Two or
three of the men told me they have been round to every
factor and proprietor in the neighbourhood, and they
could obtain no place, and nothing to do, and they did not
know where to go to, or what to do to live.</p>

<p>And for what are all these people to be reduced from
comfort to beggary? For what is this virtuous and contented
community to be scattered? I confess I can find
no answer. It is said that the factor would rather have
one tenant than many, as it saves him trouble! But so
long as the rent is punctually paid as this has been, it is
contrary to all experience to suppose that one large tenant
will pay more rent than many small ones, or that a sheep
walk can pay more rent than cultivated land.</p>

<p>Let me add that so far from the clearance at Glencalvie
being a solitary instance in this neighbourhood, it
is one of many. The tenants of Newmore, near Tain, who
I am told, amount to 16 families, are to be weeded out (as
they express it here) on the 25th, by the same Mr. Gillanders.
The same factor manages the Strathconon
estate, about 30 miles from Newmore, from which during
the last four years, some hundreds of families have been
weeded. The Government Church of that district,
built eighteen years ago, to meet the necessities of the
population, is now almost unnecessary from the want of
population. At Black Isle, near Dingwall, the same
agent is pursuing the same course, and so strong is the
feeling of the poor Highlanders at these outrageous
proceedings, so far as they are concerned wholly unwarranted
from any cause whatever, that I am informed
on the best authority, and by those who go amongst
them and hear what they say, that it is owing to the influence
of religion alone that they refrain from breaking
out into open and turbulent resistance of the law. I enclose
you the defence of this proceeding, with a list of the
names and numbers of each family in Glencalvie&mdash;in all
92 persons.<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a></p></div>

<h3>THE EVICTION OF THE ROSSES.</h3>

<p>In a “Sermon for the Times,” the Rev. Richard Hibbs
of the Episcopal Church, Edinburgh, referring to these
evictions, says:&mdash;“Take first, the awful proof how far in
oppression men can go&mdash;men highly educated and largely
gifted in every way&mdash;property, talents, all; for the most
part indeed, they are so-called noblemen. What, then,
are they doing in the Highland districts, according to the
testimony of a learned professor in this city? Why,
depopulating those districts in order to make room for
red deer. And how? By buying off the cottars, and
giving them money to emigrate? Not at all, but by
starving them out; by rendering them absolutely incapable
of procuring subsistence for themselves and
families; for they first take away from them their apportionments
of poor lands, although they may have paid
their rents; and if that don’t suffice to eradicate from
their hearts that love of the soil on which they have been
born and bred&mdash;a love which the great Proprietor of all
has manifestly implanted in our nature&mdash;why, then, these
inhuman landlords, who are far more merciful to their
very beasts, take away from these poor cottars the very
roofs above their defenceless heads, and expose them,
worn down with age and destitute of everything, to the
inclemencies of a northern sky; and this, forsooth, because
they must have plenty room for their dogs and deer.
For plentiful instances of the most wanton barbarities
under this head we need only point to the Knoydart
evictions. Here were perpetrated such enormities as
might well have caused the very sun to hide his face at
noon-day.” Macleod, referring to this sermon, <span class="lock">says:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>“It has been intimated to me by an individual who
heard this discourse on the first occasion that the statements
referring to the Highland landlords have been controverted.
I was well aware, long before the receipt of
this intimation, that some defence had appeared; and
here I can truly say, that none would have rejoiced more
than myself to find that a complete vindication had been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
made. But, unhappily, the case is far otherwise. In
order to be fully acquainted with all that had passed on
the subject, I have put myself during the week in communication
with the learned professor to whose letter,
which appeared some months ago in the <cite>Times</cite>, I referred.
From him I learn that none of his statements were
invalidated&mdash;nay, not even impugned; and he adds,
that to do this was simply impossible, as he had been
at great pains to verify the facts. All that could be called
in question was the theory that he had based upon those
facts&mdash;namely, that evictions were made for the purpose
of making room for more deer. This, of course, was open
to contradiction on the part of those landlords who had
not openly avowed their object in evicting the poor Highland
families. As to the evictions themselves&mdash;and this
was the main point&mdash;no attempt at contradiction was
made.”</p>

<p>In addition to all that the benevolent Professor [Black]
has made known to the world under this head, who has
not heard of “The Massacre of the Rosses,” and the
clearing of the glens? “I hold in my hand,” Mr. Hibbs
continued, “a little work thus entitled, which has passed
into the second edition. The author, Mr. Donald Ross&mdash;a
gentleman whom all who feel sympathy for the downtrodden
and oppressed must highly esteem. What a
humiliating picture of the barbarity and cruelty of fallen
humanity does this little book present! The reader,
utterly appalled by its horrifying statements, finds it
difficult to retain the recollection that he is perusing the
history of his own times, and country too. He would
fain yield himself to the tempting illusion that the ruthless
atrocities which are depicted were enacted in a fabulous
period, in ages long past; or at all events, if it be contemporaneous
history, that the scene of such heart-rending
cruelties, the perpetrators of which were regardless
alike of the innocency of infancy and the helplessness
of old age, is some far distant, and as yet not merely
unchristianized, but wholly savage and uncivilized region
of our globe. But alas! it is Scotland, in the latter half
of the nineteenth century, of which he treats. One feature<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
of the heart-harrowing case is the shocking and barbarous
cruelty that was practised on this occasion upon the
female portion of the evicted clan. Mr. D. Ross, in a
letter addressed to the Right Hon. the Lord Advocate,
Edinburgh, dated April 19, 1854, thus writes in reference
to one of those clearances and evictions which had just
then taken place, under the authority of a certain Sheriff
of the district, and by means of a body of policemen as
executioners:&mdash;‘The feeling on this subject, not only
in the district, but in Sutherlandshire and Ross-shire,
is, among the great majority of the people, one of universal
condemnation of the Sheriff’s reckless conduct,
and of indignation and disgust at the brutality of the
policemen. Such, indeed, was the sad havoc made on the
females on the banks of the Carron, on the memorable
31st March last, that pools of blood were on the ground&mdash;that
the grass and earth were dyed red with it&mdash;that the
dogs of the district came and licked up the blood; and
at last, such was the state of feeling of parties who went
from a distance to see the field, that a party (it is understood
by order or instructions from headquarters) actually
harrowed the ground during the night to hide the blood!</p>

<p>“‘The affair at Greenyard, on the morning of the 31st
March last, is not calculated to inspire much love of
country, or rouse the martial spirit of the already ill-used
Highlanders. The savage treatment of innocent females
on that morning, by an enraged body of police, throws
the Sinope butchery into the shade; for the Ross-shire
Haynaus have shown themselves more cruel and more
blood-thirsty than the Austrian women-floggers. What
could these poor men and women&mdash;with their wounds
and scars, and broken bones, and disjointed arms,
stretched on beds of sickness, or moving on crutches,
the result of the brutal treatment of them by the police
at Greenyard&mdash;have to dread from the invasion of Scotland
by Russia?’”</p>

<p>Commenting on this incredible atrocity, committed in
the middle of the nineteenth century, Donald Macleod
says truly that:&mdash;“It was so horrifying and so brutal
that they did not wonder at the rev. gentleman’s delicacy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
in speaking of it, and directing his hearers to peruse Mr.
Ross’s pamphlet for full information. Mr. Ross went
from Glasgow to Greenyard, all the way to investigate the
case upon the spot, and found that Mr. Taylor, a native of
Sutherland, well educated in the evicting schemes and
murderous cruelty of that county, and Sheriff-substitute
of Ross-shire, marched from Tain upon the morning of the
31st March, at the head of a strong party of armed constables,
with heavy bludgeons and fire-arms, conveyed
in carts and other vehicles, allowing them as much ardent
drink as they chose to take before leaving and on their
march, so as to qualify them for the bloody work which
they had to perform; fit for any outrage, fully equipped,
and told by the Sheriff to show no mercy to any one who
would oppose them, and not allow themselves to be
called cowards, by allowing these mountaineers victory
over them. In this excited, half-drunken state, they
came in contact with the unfortunate women of Greenyard,
who were determined to prevent the officers from
serving the summonses of removal upon them, and keep
their holding of small farms where they and their forefathers
lived and died for generations. But no time was
allowed for parley; the Sheriff gave the order to clear the
way, and, be it said to his everlasting disgrace, he struck
the first blow at a woman, the mother of a large family,
and large in the family way at the time, who tried to keep
him back; then a general slaughter commenced; the
women made noble resistance, until the bravest of them
got their arms broken; then they gave way. This did
not allay the rage of the murderous brutes, they continued
clubbing at the protectless creatures until every
one of them was stretched on the field, weltering in their
blood, or with broken arms, ribs, and bruised limbs.
In this woeful condition many of them were hand-cuffed
together, others tied with coarse ropes, huddled into carts,
and carried prisoners to Tain. I have seen myself in the
possession of Mr. Ross, Glasgow, patches or scalps
of the skin with the long hair adhering to them, which was
found upon the field a few days after this inhuman affray.
I did not see the women, but I was told that gashes were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
found on the heads of two young female prisoners in
Tain jail, which exactly corresponded with the slices of
scalps which I have seen, so that Sutherland and Ross-shire
may boast of having had the Nana Sahib and his
chiefs some few years before India, and that in the persons
of some whose education, training, and parental
example should prepare their minds to perform and act
differently. Mr. Donald Ross placed the whole affair
before the Lord Advocate for Scotland, but no notice was
taken of it by that functionary, further than that the
majesty of the law would need to be observed and attended
to.</p>

<p>“In this unfortunate country, the law of God and humanity
may be violated and trampled under foot, but the
law of wicked men which sanctions murder, rapine, and
robbery must be observed. From the same estate (the
estate of Robertson of Kindeace, if I am not mistaken in
the date) in the year 1843 the whole inhabitants of Glencalvie
were evicted in a similar manner, and so unprovided
and unprepared were they for removal at such an
inclement season of the year, that they had to shelter
themselves in a Church and a burying-ground. I have
seen myself nineteen families within this gloomy and
solitary resting abode of the dead, they were there for
months. The London <cite>Times</cite> sent a commissioner direct
from London to investigate into this case, and he did his
duty; but like the Sutherland cases, it was hushed up
in order to maintain the majesty of the law, and in order
to keep the right, the majesty of the people, and the laws
of God in the dark.</p>

<p>“In the year 1819 or ’20, about the time when the
depopulation of Sutherlandshire was completed, and the
annual conflagration of burning the houses ceased, and
when there was not a glen or strath in the county to let
to a sheep farmer, one of these insatiable monsters of
Sutherlandshire sheep farmers fixed his eyes upon a glen
in Ross-shire, inhabited by a brave, hardy race for time
immemorial. Summonses of removal were served upon
them at once. The people resisted&mdash;a military force
was brought against them&mdash;the military and the women<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
of the glen met at the entrance to the glen, and a bloody
conflict took place; without reading the riot act or taking
any other precaution, the military fired (by the order of
Sheriff MacLeod) ball cartridge upon the women; one
young girl of the name of Mathieson was shot dead on the
spot; many were wounded. When this murder was
observed by the survivors, and some young men concealed
in the background, they made a heroic sudden
rush upon the military, when a hand-to-hand melee or
fight took place. In a few minutes the military were put
to disorder by flight; in their retreat they were unmercifully
dealt with, only two of them escaping with whole
heads. The Sheriff’s coach was smashed to atoms, and he
made a narrow escape himself with a whole head. But no
legal cognizance was taken of this affair, as the Sheriff
and the military were the violators. However, for fear of
prosecution, the Sheriff settled a pension of £6 sterling
yearly upon the murdered girl’s father, and the case was
hushed up likewise. The result was that the people kept
possession of the glen, and that the proprietor and the
oldest and most insatiable of Sutherlandshire scourges
went to law, which ended in the ruination of the latter,
who died a pauper.”</p>

<p>Hugh Miller, describing a “Highland Clearing,” in one
of his able leading articles in the <cite>Witness</cite>, since published
in volume form, quotes freely from an article by John
Robertson, which appeared in the <cite>Glasgow National</cite>
in August, 1844, on the evictions of the Rosses of Glencalvie.
When the article from which Hugh Miller quotes
was written, the inhabitants of the glen had just received
notices of removal, but the evictions had not yet been
carried out. Commenting on the proceedings Hugh
Miller <span class="lock">says:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>“In an adjacent glen (to Strathcarron), through which
the Calvie works its headlong way to the Carron, that
terror of the Highlanders, a summons of removal, has
been served within the last few months on a whole community;
and the graphic sketch of Mr. Robertson relates
both the peculiar circumstances in which it has been
issued, and the feelings which it has excited. We find<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
from his testimony that the old state of things which
is so immediately on the eve of being broken up in this
locality, lacked not a few of those sources of terror to the
proprietary of the county, that are becoming so very
formidable to them in the newer states.”</p>

<p>The constitution of society in the Glens, says Mr.
Robertson, is remarkably simple. Four heads of families
are bound for the whole rental. The number of souls
was about ninety, sixteen cottages paid rent; they supported
a teacher for the education of their own children;
they supported their own poor. “The laird has never
lost a farthing of rent in bad years, such as 1836 and 1837,
the people may have required the favour of a few weeks’
delay, but they are not now a single farthing in arrears;”
that is, when they are in receipt of summonses of removal.
“For a century,” Mr. Robertson continues, speaking of
the Highlanders, “their privileges have been lessening;
they dare not now hunt the deer, or shoot the grouse or
the blackcock; they have no longer the range of the hills
for their cattle and their sheep; they must not catch a
salmon in the stream: in earth, air, and water, the rights
of the laird are greater, and the rights of the people are
smaller, than they were in the days of their forefathers.”
The same writer eloquently <span class="lock">concludes:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>“The father of the laird of Kindeace bought Glencalvie.
It was sold by a Ross two short centuries ago.
The swords of the Rosses of Glencalvie did their part in
protecting this little glen, as well as the broad lands of
Pitcalvie, from the ravages and the clutches of hostile
septs. These clansmen bled and died in the belief that
every principle of honour and morals secured their
descendants a right to subsisting on the soil. The chiefs
and their children had the same charter of the sword.
Some Legislatures have made the right of the people
superior to the right of the chief; British law-makers
made the rights of the chief everything, and those of their
followers nothing. The ideas of the morality of property
are in most men the creatures of their interests and sympathies.
Of this there cannot be a doubt, however,
the chiefs would not have had the land at all, could the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
clansmen have foreseen the present state of the Highlands&mdash;their
children in mournful groups going into
exile&mdash;the faggot of legal myrmidons in the thatch of the
feal cabin&mdash;the hearths of their homes and their lives the
green sheep-walks of the stranger. Sad it is, that it is
seemingly the will of our constituencies that our laws shall
prefer the few to the many. Most mournful will it be,
should the clansmen of the Highlands have been cleared
away, ejected, exiled, in deference to a political, a moral,
a social, and an economical mistake,&mdash;a suggestion not
of philosophy, but of mammon,&mdash;a system in which the
demon of sordidness assumed the shape of the angel of
civilization and of light.”</p>

<p>That the Eviction of the Rosses was of a harsh
character is amply corroborated by the following account,
extracted from the <cite>Inverness Courier</cite>:&mdash;“We mentioned
last week that considerable obstruction was anticipated
in the execution of the summonses of removal upon the
tenants of Major Robertson of Kindeace, on his property
of Greenyards, near Bonar Bridge. The office turned
out to be of a very formidable character. At six o’clock
on the morning of Friday last, Sheriff Taylor proceeded
from Tain, accompanied by several Sheriff’s officers, and
a police force of about thirty more, partly belonging to the
constabulary force of Ross-shire, and partly to that of
Inverness-shire,&mdash;the latter under the charge of Mr.
Mackay, inspector, Fort William. On arriving at Greenyards,
which is nearly four miles from Bonar Bridge,
it was found that about three hundred persons, fully
two-thirds of whom were women, had assembled from
the county round about, all apparently prepared to resist
the execution of the law. The women stood in front,
armed with stones, and the men occupied the background,
all, or nearly all, furnished with sticks.</p>

<p>“The Sheriff attempted to reason with the crowd, and
to show them the necessity of yielding to the law: but
his efforts were fruitless; some of the women tried to lay
hold of him and to strike him, and after a painful effort
to effect the object in view by peaceable means&mdash;which
was renewed in vain by Mr. Cumming, the superintendent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
of the Ross-shire police&mdash;the Sheriff was reluctantly
obliged to employ force. The force was led by Mr.
Cumming into the crowd, and, after a sharp resistance,
which happily lasted only a few minutes, the people were
dispersed, and the Sheriff was enabled to execute the summonses
upon the four tenants. The women, as they bore
the brunt of the battle, were the principal sufferers. A
large number of them&mdash;fifteen or sixteen, we believe, were
seriously hurt, and of these several are under medical
treatment; one woman, we believe, still lies in a precarious
condition. The policemen appear to have used
their batons with great force, but they escaped themselves
almost unhurt. Several correspondents from the district,
who do not appear, however, to make sufficient allowance
for the critical position of affairs, and the necessity
of at once impressing so large a multitude with the serious
nature of the case, complain that the policemen used their
batons with wanton cruelty. Others state that they not
only did their duty, but that less firmness might have
proved fatal to themselves. The instances of violence
are certainly, though very naturally, on the part of the
attacking force; several batons were smashed in the
melee; a great number of men and women were seriously
hurt, especially about the head and face, while not one of
the policemen, so far as we can learn, suffered any injury
in consequence. As soon as the mob was fairly dispersed,
the police made active pursuit, in the hope of catching
some of the ringleaders. The men had, however, fled,
and the only persons apprehended were some women,
who had been active in the opposition, and who had been
wounded. They were conveyed to the prison at Tain,
but liberated on bail next day, through the intercession
of a gallant friend, who became responsible for their
appearance.”</p>

<p>“A correspondent writes,” continues the <cite>Courier</cite>, “ten
young women were wounded in the back of the skull and
other parts of their bodies.... The wounds on
these women show plainly the severe manner in which
they were dealt with by the police when they were retreating.
It was currently reported last night that one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
of them was dead; and the feeling of indignation is so
strong against the manner in which the constables have
acted, that I fully believe the life of any stranger, if he
were supposed to be an officer of the law, would not be
worth twopence in the district.”</p>

<p>The <cite>Northern Ensign</cite>, referring to the same case, says:&mdash;“One
day lately a preventive officer with two cutter
men made their appearance on the boundaries of the
estate and were taken for Tain Sheriff-officers. The
signals were at once given, and in course of half-an-hour
the poor gauger and his men were surrounded by 300
men and women, who would not be remonstrated with
either in English or Gaelic; the poor fellows were taken
and denuded of their clothing, all papers and documents
were extracted and burnt, amongst which was a purse
with a considerable quantity of money. In this state
they were carried shoulder-high off the estate, and left
at the braes of Downie, where the great Culrain riot took
place thirty years ago.”</p>

<h3>KINTAIL.</h3>

<p>During the first years of the century a great many were
cleared from Kintail by Seaforth at the instigation of his
Kintail factor, Duncan Mor Macrae, and his father, who
themselves added the land taken from the ancient
tenantry to their own sheep farms, already far too extensive.
In Glengarry, Canada, a few years ago, we met
one man, 93 years of age, who was among the evicted.
He was in excellent circumstances, his three sons having
three valuable farms of their own, and considered wealthy
in the district. In the same county there is a large
colony of Kintail men, the descendants of those cleared
from that district, all comfortable, many of them very
well off, one of them being then member for his county in
the dominion Parliament. While this has been the case
with many of the evicted from Kintail and their descendants
in Canada, the grasping sheep farmer who was the
original cause of their eviction from their native land,
died ruined and penniless; and the Seaforths, not long<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
after, had to sell the last inch of their ancient inheritance
in Lochalsh and Kintail. Shortly after these Glenelchaig
evictions, about fifty families were banished in the same
way and by the same people from the district of Letterfearn.
This property has also changed hands since, and
is now in possession of Sir Alexander Matheson, Baronet
of Lochalsh. Letter of Lochalsh was cleared by Sir Hugh
Innes, almost as soon as he came into possession by purchase
of that portion of the ancient heritage of Seaforth
and Kintail. The property has since passed into the
hands of the Lillingstones.</p>

<h3>COIGEACH.</h3>

<p>The attempt to evict the Coigeach crofters must also
be mentioned. Here the people made a stout resistance,
the women disarming about twenty policemen and sheriff-officers,
burning the summonses in a heap, throwing their
batons into the sea, and ducking the representatives of
the law in a neighbouring pool. The men formed the
second line of defence, in case the women should receive
any ill-treatment. They, however, never put a finger
on the officers of law, all of whom returned home without
serving a single summons or evicting a single crofter.
The proceedings of her subordinates fortunately came to
the ears of the noble proprietrix, with the result that the
Coigeach tenants are still where they were, and are to-day
among the most comfortable crofters in the north of Scotland.</p>

<h3>STRATHCONON.<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a></h3>

<p>From 1840 to 1848 Strathconon was almost entirely
cleared of its ancient inhabitants to make room for sheep
and deer, as in other places; and also for the purposes of
extensive forest plantations. The property was under
trustees when the harsh proceedings were commenced by
the factor, Mr. Rose, a notorious Dingwall solicitor.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
He began by taking away, first, the extensive hill-pasture,
for generations held as club-farms by the townships, thus
reducing the people from a position of comfort and independence;
and secondly, as we saw done elsewhere,
finally evicting them from the arable portion of the strath,
though they were not a single penny in arrear of rent.
Coirre-Bhuic and Scard-Roy were first cleared, and given,
respectively, as sheep-farms to Mr. Brown, from Morayshire,
and Colin Munro, from Dingwall. Mr. Balfour,
when he came of age, cleared Coire-Feola and Achadh-an-eas;
Carnach was similarly treated, while no fewer
than twenty-seven families were evicted from Glen-Meine
alone. Baile-a-Mhuilinn and Baile-na-Creige were
cleared in 1844, no fewer than twenty-four families from
these townships removing to the neighbourhood of
Knock-farrel and Loch Ussie, above Dingwall, where
they were provided with holdings by the late John Hay
Mackenzie of Cromartie, father of the present Duchess of
Sutherland, and where a few of themselves and many
of their descendants are now in fairly comfortable circumstances.
A great many more found shelter on various
properties in the Black Isle&mdash;some at Drynie Park,
Maol-Bui; others at Kilcoy, Allangrange, Cromarty,
and the Aird.</p>

<p>It is computed that from four to five hundred souls
were thus driven from Strathconon, and cast adrift on the
world, including a large number of persons quite helpless,
from old age, blindness, and other infirmities. The scenes
were much the same as we have described in connection
with other places. There is, however, one aspect of the
harshness and cruelty practised on the Strathconon
people, not applicable in many other cases, namely,
that in most instances where they settled down and reclaimed
land, they were afterwards re-evicted, and the
lands brought into cultivation by themselves, taken
from them, without any compensation whatever, and
given at enhanced rents to large farmers. This is
specially true of those who settled down in the Black
Isle, where they reclaimed a great deal of waste now making
some of the best farms in that district. Next after<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
Mr. Rose of Dingwall, the principal instrument in clearing
Strathconon, was the late James Gillanders of Highfield,
already so well and unfavourably known to the reader in
connection with the evictions at Glencalvie and elsewhere.</p>

<p>It may be remarked that the Strathconon evictions are
worthy of note for the forcible illustration they furnish of
how, by these arbitrary and unexpected removals, hardships
and ruin have frequently been brought on families
and communities who were at the time in contented and
comfortable circumstances. At one time, and previous
to the earlier evictions, perhaps no glen of its size in the
Highlands had a larger population than Strathconon.
The club farm system, once so common in the North,
seems to have been peculiarly successful here. Hence
a large proportion of the people were well to do, but when
suddenly called upon to give up their hill pasture, and
afterwards their arable land, and in the absence of other
suitable places to settle in, the means they had very soon
disappeared, and the trials and difficulties of new conditions
had to be encountered. As a rule, in most of these
Highland evictions, the evicted were lost sight of, they
having either emigrated to foreign lands or become
absorbed in the ever-increasing unemployed population
of the large towns. In the case of Strathconon it was
different, as has been already stated; many of the
families evicted were allowed to settle on some of the
wildest unreclaimed land in the Black Isle. Their subsequent
history there, and the excellent agricultural condition
into which they in after years brought their small
holdings, is a standing refutation of the charge so often
made against the Highland people, that they are lazy
and incapable of properly cultivating the land.</p>

<h3>THE BLACK ISLE.</h3>

<p>Respecting the estates of Drynie and Kilcoy, a correspondent,
who says, “I well remember my excessive grief
when my father had to leave the farm which his forefathers
had farmed for five generations,” <span class="lock">writes:&mdash;</span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span></p>

<p>“All the tenants to the east of Drynie, as far
as Craigiehow, were turned out, one by one, to make
room for one large tenant, Mr. Robertson, who had
no less than four centres for stackyards. A most
prosperous tenantry were turned out to make room for
him, and what is the end of it all! Mr. Robertson has
come to grief as a farmer, and now holds a very humble
position in the town of Inverness. Drumderfit used to
be occupied by fifteen or sixteen tenants who were
gradually, and from time to time, evicted, during the
last fifty years. Balnakyle was tenanted by five very
comfortable and respectable farmers, four of whom were
turned out within the last thirty years; Balnaguie
was occupied by three; Torr by six; and Croft-cruive
by five; the once famous names of Drum-na-marg and
Moreton are now extinct, as well as the old tenantry whose
forefathers farmed these places for generations. The
present farm of Kilcoy includes a number of holdings
whose tenants were evicted to make room for one large
farmer;” and this is equally true of many others in the
district. Nothing can better illustrate the cruel manner
in which the ancient tenantry of the country have been
treated than these facts; and special comment on the
evictions from Strathconon and the Black Isle, after what
has been said about others of a similar character, would be
superfluous.</p>

<h3>THE ISLAND OF LEWIS.</h3>

<p>No one was evicted from the Island of Lewis, in the
strict sense of the term, but 2231 souls had to leave it
between 1851 and 1863. To pay their passage money,
their inland railway fares on arrival, and to provide them
with clothing and other furnishings, the late Sir James
Matheson paid a sum of £11,855. Notwithstanding
all this expenditure, many of these poor people would
have died from starvation on their arrival without the
good offices of friends in Canada.</p>

<p>In 1841, before Mr. Matheson bought it, a cargo of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
emigrants from the Lews arrived at Quebec late in the
autumn, accompanied by a Rev. Mr. Maclean, sent out to
minister to their spiritual wants, but it appears that no
provision had been made for the more pressing demands of
a severe Canadian winter; and were it not for the Saint
Andrew’s Society of Montreal, every soul of them would
have been starved to death that winter in a strange land.
The necessities of the case, and how this patriotic Society
saved their countrymen from a horrid death will be seen
on perusal of the following minutes, extracted from the
books of the Society, during the writer’s recent tour in
Canada:&mdash;“A special meeting of the office-bearers was
summoned on the 20th September, 1841, to take into
consideration an application made by Mr. Morris, President
of the Emigration Association of the district of St.
Francis, for some pecuniary aid to a body of 229 destitute
emigrants who had recently arrived from the Island of
Lewis (Scotland), and who were then supported chiefly
by the contributions of the charitable inhabitants of the
town of Sherbrooke and its neighbourhood. Mr. Morris’
letter intimated that unless other assistance was received,
it would be impossible for these emigrants to outlive the
winter, as they were in a state of utter destitution, and
the inhabitants of the township could not support so
large a number of persons from their own unaided resources.
The meeting decided that the Constitution
of the Society prohibited them from applying its funds to
an object like the one presented&mdash;it did not appear to
authorise the granting of relief from its funds except to
cases of destitution in the city; but as this case appeared
of an urgent nature, and one particularly calling for
assistance, Messrs. Hew Ramsay and Neil M’Intosh were
appointed to collect subscriptions on behalf of the emigrants.
This committee acquitted itself with great
diligence and success, having collected the handsome
sum of £234 14s. 6d., the whole of which was, at different
times, remitted to Mr. Morris, and expended by him
in this charity. Letters were received from Mr. Morris,
expressing the gratitude of the emigrants for this large
and timely aid, which was principally the means of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
keeping them from starvation.” The whole of these
emigrants are now in easy circumstances.</p>

<p>Commenting on the conduct of those in power, who sent
out their poor tenantry totally unprovided for, is unnecessary.
The idea of sending out a minister and nothing
else, in such circumstances, makes one shudder to
think of the uses which are sometimes made of the clergy,
and how, in such cases, the Gospel they are supposed
not only to preach but to practise, is only in many
instances caricatured. The provisions sent by the
Society had to be forwarded to where these starving
emigrants were, a distance of 80 miles from Sherbrooke,
on sledges, through a trackless and dense forest. The
descendants of these people now form a happy and prosperous
community at Lingwick and Winslow.</p>

<h3>LECKMELM.<br />

MR. ALEXANDER MACKENZIE ON THE
LECKMELM EVICTIONS.</h3>

<p>This small property, in the Parish of Lochbroom,
changed hands in 1879, Mr. A. C. Pirie, paper manufacturer,
Aberdeen, having purchased it for £19,000
from Colonel Davidson, now of Tulloch. No sooner
did it come into Mr. Pirie’s possession than a notice, dated
2nd November, 1879, in the following terms, was issued
to all the <span class="lock">tenants:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>“I am instructed by Mr. Pirie, proprietor of Leckmelm,
to give you notice that the present arrangements by which
you hold the cottage, byre, and other buildings, together
with lands on that estate, will cease from and after the
term of Martinmas, 1880; and further, I am instructed
to intimate to you that at the said term of Martinmas,
1880, Mr. Pirie purposes taking the whole arable and
pasture lands, but that he is desirous of making arrangements
whereby you may continue tenant of the cottage
upon terms and conditions yet to be settled upon. I
have further to inform you that unless you and the other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
tenants at once prevent your sheep and other stock from
grazing or trespassing upon the enclosures and hill, and
other lands now in the occupation or possession of the
said Mr. Pirie, he will not, upon any conditions, permit
you to remain in the cottage you now occupy, after the
said term of Martinmas, 1880, but will clear all off the
estate, and take down the cottages.”</p>

<p>This notice affected twenty-three families, numbering
above one hundred souls. Sixteen tenants paid between
them a rent of £96 10s.&mdash;ranging from £3 to £12 each per
annum. The stock allowed them was 72 head of cattle,
8 horses, and 320 sheep. The arable portion of Leckmelm
was about the best tilled and the most productive land
in possession of any crofters in the parish. It could all be
worked with the plough, now a very uncommon thing in
the Highlands; for almost invariably land of that class
is in the hands of the proprietors themselves, when not
let to sheep farmers or sportsmen. The intention of the
new proprietor was strictly carried out. At Martinmas,
1880, he took every inch of land&mdash;arable and pastoral&mdash;into
his own hands, and thus by one cruel stroke, reduced
a comfortable tenantry from comparative affluence and
independence to the position of mere cottars and day
labourers, absolutely dependent for subsistence on his
own will and the likes or dislikes of his subordinates,
who may perhaps, for a short time, be in a position to
supply the remnant that will remain, in their altered circumstances,
with such common labour as trenching,
draining, fencing, carrying stones, lime and mortar, for
the laird’s mansion-house and outhouses. With the
exception of one, all the tenants who remained are still
permitted to live in their old cottages, but they are not
permitted to keep a living thing about them&mdash;not even a
hen. They are existing in a state of abject dependence
on Mr. Pirie’s will and that of his servants; and in a
constant state of terror that next they will even be turned
out of their cottages. As regards work and the necessaries
of life, they have been reduced to that of common
navvies. In place of milk, butter, and cheese in fair
abundance, they have now to be satisfied with sugar,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
treacle, or whatever else they can buy, to their porridge
and potatoes, and their supply of meat, grown and fed
hitherto by themselves, is gone for ever. Two, a man and
his wife, if not more, have since been provided for by the
Parochial authorities, and, no doubt, that will ultimately
be the fate of many more of this once thriving and contented
people.</p>

<p>An agitation against Mr. Pirie’s conduct was raised at
the time, and the advantage which he had taken of his
position was universally condemned by the press (excepting
the <cite>Scotsman</cite>, of course), and by the general
public voice of the country; but conscious of his strength,
and that the law, made by the landlords in their
own interest, was on his side, he relentlessly and persistently
carried out his cruel purpose to the bitter end,
and evicted from their lands and hill grazings every soul
upon his property; but in the meantime allowed them to
remain in their cottages, with the exception of Donald
Munro, to whose case reference will be made hereafter,
and two other persons whose houses were pulled down
and themselves evicted.</p>

<p>When the notices of removal were received, the Rev.
John MacMillan, Free Church minister of the parish,
called public attention to Mr. Pirie’s proceedings in the
Northern newspapers, and soon the eye of the whole
country was directed to this modern evictor&mdash;a man, in
other respects, reputed considerate and even kind to
those under him in his business of paper manufacturing
in Aberdeen. People, in their simplicity, for years back,
thought that evictions on such a large scale, in the face
of a more enlightened public opinion, had become mere
unpleasant recollections of a barbarous past; forgetting
that the same laws which permitted the clearances of
Sutherland and other portions of the Scottish Highlands
during the first half of the present century were still in
force, ready to be applied by any tyrant who had the
courage, for personal ends, to outrage the more advanced
and humane public opinion of the present generation.</p>

<p>The noble conduct of the Rev. Mr. MacMillan, in connection
with those evictions, deserves commemoration in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
a work in which the name of his prototype in Sutherland,
the Rev. Mr. Sage, shows to such advantage during the
infamous clearances in that county, already described
at length. At the urgent request of many friends of the
Highland crofters, resident in Inverness, Mr. MacMillan
agreed to lay the case of his evicted parishioners before
the public. Early in December, 1880, he delivered an
address in Inverness to one of the largest and most
enthusiastic meetings which has ever been held in that
town, and we cannot do better here than quote at considerable
length from his instructive, eloquent, and rousing
appeal on that occasion. Though his remarks do not seem
to have influenced Mr. Pirie’s conduct, or to have benefited
his unfortunate subjects, the Inverness meeting was
the real beginning in earnest of the subsequent movement
throughout the Highlands in favour of Land Reform,
and the curtailment of landlord power over their unfortunate
tenants. Mr. Pirie can thus claim to have done
our poorer countrymen no small amount of good, though
probably, quite contrary to his intentions, by his cruel
and high-handed conduct in dealing with the ancient
tenants of Leckmelm. He has set the heather on fire,
and it is likely to continue burning until such proceedings
as those for which he is responsible at Leckmelm will be
finally made impossible in Scotland. Mr. MacMillan
after informing his audience that Mr. Pirie “is now in a
fair way of reaching a notoriety which he little dreamt
of when he became owner of the Leckmelm estate,” proceeds
to tell how the harsh proceedings were gone about,
and <span class="lock">says:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>“As the public are aware, Mr. Pirie’s first step after
becoming owner of the estate, was to inform the tenantry,
by the hands of Mr. Manners, C.E., Inverness, that at
Martinmas following they were to deliver their arable
land and stock, consisting of sheep and cattle, into his
hands, but that some of them, on conditions yet to be
revealed, and on showing entire submission to the new
<i>régime</i> of things, and, withal, a good certificate of character
from his factotum, William Gould, might remain
in their cottages to act as serfs or slaves on his farm. On<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
this conditional promise they were to live in the best of
hope, for the future and all at the mercy of the absolute
master of the situation, with a <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">summum jus</i> at his back
to enable him to effect all the purposes of his heart. As
a prologue to the drama which was to follow, and to give a
sample of what they might expect in the sequel, two acts
were presented, or properly speaking, one act in two parts.
These were to prepare them for what was to come, reminding
us of what we read somewhere in our youth,
of a husband who on marrying his fair spouse wished to
teach her prompt obedience to all his commands, whatever
their character. His first lesson in this direction
was one assuredly calculated to strike terror into her
tender breast. It was the shooting on the spot of the
horse which drew his carriage or conveyance, on showing
some slight restiveness. The second lesson was of a
similar nature; we can easily imagine that his object was
gained. Then, after coming home, he commanded his
spouse to untie his boots and shoes, and take them off,
and to engage in the most servile acts. Of course prompt
obedience was given to all these commands and his end
was gained. His wife was obedient to him to the last
degree. Of the wisdom and propriety of such a procedure
in a husband towards his lawful wife, I shall not
here and now wait to enquire, but one thing is plain to us
all; there was a species of earthly and carnal wisdom in
it which was entirely overshadowed by its cruelty.</p>

<p>“Now this illustrates exactly how Mr. Pirie acted towards
the people of Leckmelm. To strike terror into their
hearts, first of all, two houses were pulled down, I might
say about the ears of their respective occupants, without
any warning whatever, except a verbal one of the shortest
kind. The first was a deaf pauper woman, about middle
life, living alone for years in a bothy of her own, altogether
apart from the other houses, beside a purling
stream, where she had at all seasons pure water to drink
if her bread was at times somewhat scanty. After this
most cruel eviction no provision was made for the helpless
woman, but she was allowed to get shelter elsewhere or
anywhere, as best she could. If any of you ever go the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
way of Leckmelm you can see a gamekeeper’s house, the
gentry of our land, close to the side of Iseabal Bheag’s
bothy, and a dog kennel quite in its neighbourhood, or
as I said in one of my letters, adorning it. This then is
act the first of this drama. Act second comes next.
Mrs. Campbell was a widow with two children; after
the decease of her husband she tried to support herself
and them by serving in gentlemen’s families as a servant.
Whether she was all the time in Tulloch’s family I cannot
say, but, at all events, it was from that family she returned
to Leckmelm, in failing health, and on getting
rather heavy for active service. Of course her father had
died since she had left, and the house in which he lived
and died, and in which in all likelihood he had reared
his family, and in which he was born and bred, was now
tenantless. It was empty, the land attached to it being
in the hands of another person. Here Widow Campbell
turned aside for a while until something else would in
kind Providence turn up. But, behold, during her
sojourn from her native township, another king arose,
who knew not Joseph, and the inexorable edict had gone
forth to raze her habitation to the ground. Her house
also was pulled down about her ears. This woman has
since gone to America, the asylum of many an evicted
family from hearth and home. Such tragedies as I have
mentioned roused some of us to remonstrate with the
actors engaged in them, and to the best of our ability
to expose their conduct, and, furthermore, we have
brought them to the bar of public judgment to pass their
verdict, which I hope before all is over, will be one of
condemnation and condign punishment.”</p>

<p>Having referred at some length to the worst classes of
evictions throughout the Highlands in the past, and
already described in this work, the reverend lecturer
<span class="lock">proceeded:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>“But there is another way, a more gentle, politic, and
insinuating way at work which depopulates our country
quite as effectually as the wholesale clearances of which
we have been speaking and against which we protest, and
to which we must draw your attention for a little. There<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
are many proprietors who get the name of being good and
kind to their tenants, and who cannot be charged with
evicting any of them save for misbehaviour&mdash;a deserving
cause at all times&mdash;who are nevertheless inch by inch
secretly and stealthily laying waste the country and
undermining the well-being of our people. I have some
of these gentlemen before my mind at this moment.
When they took possession of their estates all promised
fair and well, but by-and-bye the fatal blow was struck,
to dispossess the people of their sheep. Mark that <em>first
move</em> and resist it to the utmost. As long as tenants have
a hold of the hill pasture by sheep, and especially if it be
what we term a commonage or club farm, it is impossible
to lay it waste in part. But once you snap this tie
asunder, you are henceforth at the mercy of the owner
to do with you as he pleases. This then is how the
business is transacted, and in the most business-like
fashion too. To be sure none are to be forcibly evicted
from their holdings: that would be highly impolitic,
because it would bring public condemnation on the
sacred heads of the evictors, which some of them could in
no way confront, for they have a character and a name
to sustain, and also because they are more susceptible
to the failings common to humanity. They are moving,
too, in the choicest circles of society. It would not do
that their names should be figuring in every newspaper
in the land, as cruel and oppressive landlords, or that the
Rev. this and the Rev. that should excommunicate
them from society and stigmatise them as tyrants and
despots. But all are not so sensitive as this of name and
character, as we see abundantly demonstrated, because
they have none to lose. You might expose them upon a
gibbet before the gaze of an assembled universe and they
would hardly blush, “they are harder than the nether
mill-stone.” But the more sensitive do their work, all
the same, after all, and it is done in this fashion. When a
tenant dies, or removes otherwise, the order goes forth
that his croft or lot is to be laid waste. It is not given
to a neighbouring tenant, except in some instances, nor
to a stranger, to occupy it. In this inch-by-inch clear<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>ance,
the work of depopulation is effected in a few years,
or in a generation at most, quite as effectually as by the
more glaring and reprehensible method. This more
secret and insinuating way of depopulating our native
land should be as stoutly resisted as the more open and
defiant one, the result it produces being the same.”</p>

<p>Describing the character of the Highlanders, as shown
by their conduct in our Highland regiments, and the impossibility
of recruiting from them in future, if harsh
evictions are not stopped, the reverend gentlemen <span class="lock">continued:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>“Let me give you words more eloquent than mine
on this point, which will show the infatuation of our
Government in allowing her bravest soldiers to be driven
to foreign lands and to be crushed and oppressed by the
tyrant’s rod. After having asked, What have these
people done against the State, when they were so remorselessly
driven from their native shores, year by year in
batches of thousands? What class have they wronged
that they should suffer a penalty so dreadful? this
writer<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> gives the answer:&mdash;‘They have done no wrong.
Yearly they have sent forth their thousands from their
glens to follow the battle flag of Britain wherever it flew.
It was a Highland <em>rearlorn</em> hope that followed the broken
wreck of Cumberland’s army after the disastrous day at
Fontenoy, when more British soldiers lay dead upon the
field than fell at Waterloo itself. It was another Highland
regiment that scaled the rock-face over the St.
Lawrence, and first formed a line in the September
dawn on the level sward of Abraham. It was a Highland
line that broke the power of the Maharatta hordes
and gave Wellington his maiden victory at Assaye.
Thirty-four battalions marched from these glens to fight
in America, Germany, and India ere the 18th century had
run its course; and yet, while abroad over the earth,
Highlanders were the first in assault and the last in retreat,
their lowly homes in far away glens were being
dragged down, and the wail of women and the cry of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
children went out on the same breeze that bore too upon
its wings the scent of heather, the freshness of gorse
blossom, and the myriad sweets that made the lowly life
of Scotland’s peasantry blest with health and happiness.
These are crimes done in the dark hours of strife, and
amid the blaze of man’s passions, that sometimes make
the blood run cold as we read them; but they are not so
terrible in their red-handed vengeance as the cold malignity
of a civilized law, which permits a brave and noble
race to disappear by the operation of its legalised injustice.
To convert the Highland glens into vast wastes
untenanted by human beings; to drive forth to distant
and inhospitable shores men whose forefathers had held
their own among these hills, despite Roman legion, Saxon
archer, or Norman chivalry, men whose sons died freely
for England’s honour through those wide dominions
their bravery had won for her. Such was the work of
laws formed in a cruel mockery of name by the Commons
of England. Thus it was, that about the year
1808 the stream of Highland soldiery, which had been
gradually ebbing, gave symptoms of running completely
dry. Recruits for Highland regiments could not be
obtained for the simple reason that the Highlands had
been depopulated. Six regiments which from the date
of their foundation had worn the kilt and bonnet were
ordered to lay aside their distinctive uniform and henceforth
became merged into the ordinary line corps. From
the mainland the work of destruction passed rapidly to
the isles. These remote resting-places of the Celt were
quickly cleared, during the first ten years of the great
war, Skye had given 4000 of its sons to the army. It has
been computed that 1600 Skyemen stood in the ranks at
Waterloo. To-day in Skye, far as the eye can reach,
nothing but a bare brown waste is to be seen, where still
the mounds and ruined gables rise over the melancholy
landscapes, sole vestiges of a soldier race for ever passed
away.’”</p>

<p>In January, 1882, news had reached Inverness that
Murdo Munro, one of the most comfortable tenants on
the Leckmelm property, had been turned out, with his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
wife and young family, in the snow; whereupon the
writer started to enquire into the facts, and spent a whole
day among the people. What he had seen proved to be
as bad as any of the evictions of the past, except that it
applied in this instance only to one family. Murdo
Munro was too independent for the local managers, and
to some extent led the people in their opposition to Mr.
Pirie’s proceedings: he was first persecuted and afterwards
evicted in the most cruel fashion. Other reasons
were afterwards given for the manner in which this poor
man and his family were treated, but it has been shown
conclusively, in a report published at the time, that these
reasons were an after-thought.<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> From this report we
shall quote a few <span class="lock">extracts:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>“So long as the laws of the land permit men like Mr.
Pirie to drive from the soil, without compensation, the
men who, by their labour and money, made their properties
what they are, it must be admitted that he is
acting within his legal rights, however much we may deplore
the manner in which he has chosen to exercise them.
We have to deal more with the system which allows him
to act thus, than with the special reasons which he considers
sufficient to justify his proceedings; and if his conduct
in Leckmelm will, as I trust it may, hasten on a
change in our land legislation, the hardships endured
by the luckless people who had the misfortune to come
under his unfeeling yoke and his ideas of moral right and
wrong, will be more than counterbalanced by the benefits
which will ultimately accrue to the people at large. This
is why I, and I believe the public, take such an interest
in this question of the evictions at Leckmelm.</p>

<p>“I have made the most careful and complete inquiry
possible among Mr. Pirie’s servants, the tenants, and the
people of Ullapool. Mr. Pirie’s local manager, after I
had informed him of my object, and put him on his guard
as to the use which I might make of his answers, informed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
me that he never had any fault to find with Munro, that
he always found him quite civil, and that he had nothing
to say against him. The tenants, without exception,
spoke of him as a good neighbour. The people of Ullapool,
without exception, so far as I could discover,
after enquiries from the leading men in every section of
the community, speak well of him, and condemn Mr.
Pirie. Munro is universally spoken of as one of the best
and most industrious workmen in the whole parish,
and, by his industry and sobriety, he has been able to
save a little money in Leckmelm, where he was able to
keep a fairly good stock on his small farm, and worked
steadily with a horse and cart. The stock handed over
by him to Mr. Pirie consisted of 1 bull, 2 cows, 1 stirk,
1 Highland pony, and about 40 sheep, which represented a
considerable saving. Several of the other tenants had a
similar stock, and some of them had even more, all of
which they had to dispense with under the new arrangements,
and consequently lost the annual income in money
and produce available therefrom. We all know that
the sum received for this stock cannot last long, and
cannot be advantageously invested in anything else.
The people must now live on their small capital, instead
of what it produced, so long as it lasts, after which they
are sure to be helpless, and many of them become chargeable
to the parish.</p>

<p>“The system of petty tyranny which prevails at Leckmelm
is scarcely credible. Contractors have been told
not to employ Munro. For this I have the authority
of some of the contractors themselves. Local employers
of labour were requested not to employ any longer people
who had gone to look on among the crowd, while Munro’s
family, goods, and furniture, were being turned out.
Letters were received by others complaining of the same
thing from higher quarters, and threatening ulterior
consequences. Of all this I have the most complete
evidence, but in the interests of those involved, I shall
mention no names, except in Court, where I challenge Mr.
Pirie and his subordinates to the proof if they deny it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>“The extract in the action of removal was signed only
on the 24th of January last in Dingwall. On the following
day the charge is dated, and two days after, on the
27th of January, the eviction is complete. When I visited
the scene on Friday morning, I found a substantially built
cottage, and a stable at the end of it, unroofed to within
three feet of the top on either side, and the whole surroundings
a perfect scene of desolation; the thatch, and part of
the furniture, including portions of broken bedsteads, tubs,
basins, teapots, and various other articles, strewn outside.
The cross-beams, couples, and cabars were still there,
a portion of the latter brought from Mr. Pirie’s manager,
and paid for within the last three years. The Sheriff
officers had placed a padlock on the door, but I made
my way to the inside of the house through one of the
windows from which the frame and glass had been removed.
I found that the house, before the partitions
had been removed, consisted of two good-sized rooms and
a closet, with fireplace and chimney in each gable, the
crook still hanging in one of them, the officer having
apparently been unable to remove it after a considerable
amount of wrenching. The kitchen window, containing
eight panes of glass, was still whole, but the closet window,
with four panes, had been smashed; while the one
in the “ben” end of the house had been removed. The
cottage, as crofters’ houses go, must have been fairly
comfortable. Indeed, the cottages in Leckmelm are altogether
superior to the usual run of crofters’ houses on the
West Coast, and the tenants are allowed to have been the
most comfortable in all respects in the parish, before the
land was taken from them. They are certainly not the
poor, miserable creatures, badly housed, which Mr.
Pirie and his friends led the public to believe within the
last two years.</p>

<p>“The barn in which the wife and infant had to remain
all night had the upper part of both gables blown out by
the recent storm, and the door was scarcely any protection
from the weather. The potatoes, which had been
thrown out in showers of snow, were still there, gathered
and a little earth put over them by the friendly neighbours.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span></p>

<p>“The mother and children wept piteously during the
eviction, and many of the neighbours, afraid to succour
or shelter them, were visibly affected to tears; and the
whole scene was such that, if Mr. Pirie could have seen
it, I feel sure that he would never consent to be held responsible
for another. His humanity would soon drive
his stern ideas of legal right out of his head, and we would
hear no more of evictions at Leckmelm.”</p>

<p>Those of the tenants who are still at Leckmelm are
permitted to remain in their cottages as half-yearly tenants
on payment of 12s. per annum, but liable to be removed
at any moment that their absolute lord may take
it into his head to evict them; or, what is much more
precarious, when they may give the slightest offence to
any of his meanest subordinates.</p>

<h3>LOCHCARRON.<br />

<span class="smcap">By</span> ALEXANDER MACKENZIE.</h3>

<p>The following account was written in April, 1882, after
a most careful enquiry on the spot:&mdash;So much whitewash
has been distributed in our Northern newspapers of late
by “Local Correspondents,” in the interest of personal
friends who are responsible for the Lochcarron evictions&mdash;the
worst and most indefensible that have ever been
attempted even in the Highlands&mdash;that we consider it a
duty to state the actual facts. We are really sorry for
those more immediately concerned, but our friendly
feeling for them otherwise cannot be allowed to come
between us and our plain duty. A few days before the
famous “Battle of the Braes,” in the Isle of Skye, we
received information that summonses of ejectment
were served on Mackenzie and Maclean, Lochcarron.
The writer at once communicated with Mr. Dugald
Stuart, the proprietor, intimating to him the statements
received, and asking him if they were accurate, and if
Mr. Stuart had anything to say in explanation of them.
Mr. Stuart immediately replied, admitting the accuracy
of the statements generally, but maintaining that he had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
good and valid reasons for carrying out the evictions,
which he expressed himself anxious to explain to us on the
following day, while passing through Inverness on his
way South. Unfortunately, his letter reached us too
late, and we were unable to see him. The only reason
which he vouchsafed to give in his letter was to the following
effect:&mdash;“Was it at all likely that he, a Highlander,
born and brought up in the Highlands, the son
of a Highlander, and married to a Highland lady, would
be guilty of evicting any of his tenants without good
cause?” We replied that, unfortunately, all these
reasons could be urged by most of those who had in the
past depopulated the country, but expressing a hope that,
in his case, the facts stated by him would prove sufficient
to restrain him from carrying out his determination to
evict parents admittedly innocent of their sons’ proceedings,
even if those proceedings were unjustifiable. Early
in April, 1882, we proceeded to Lochcarron to make
enquiry on the spot, and the writer on his return from
Skye a few days later reported as follows to the Highland
Land Law Reform <span class="lock">Association:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>“Of all the cases of eviction which have hitherto come
under my notice I never heard of any so utterly unjustifiable
as those now in course of being carried out by Mr. D.
Stuart in Lochcarron. The circumstances which led
up to these evictions are as follows:&mdash;In March, 1881, two
young men, George Mackenzie and Donald Maclean,
masons, entered into a contract with Mr. Stuart’s ground
officer for the erection of a sheep fank, and a dispute
afterwards arose as to the payment for the work. When
the factor, Mr. Donald Macdonald, Tormore, was some
time afterwards collecting the rents in the district, the
contractors approached him and related their grievance
against the ground officer, who, while the men were in the
room, came in and addressed them in libellous and
defamatory language, for which they have since obtained
substantial damages and expenses, in all amounting to
£22 13s. 8d., in the Sheriff Court of the County. I have a
certified copy of the whole proceedings in Court in my
possession, and, without going into the merits, what I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
have just stated is the result, and Mr. Stuart and his
ground officer became furious.</p>

<p>“The contractors are two single men who live with
their parents, the latter being crofters on Mr. Stuart’s
property, and as the real offenders&mdash;if such can be called
men who have stood up for and succeeded in establishing
their rights and their characters in Court&mdash;could not be
got at, Mr. Stuart issued summonses of ejection against
their parents&mdash;parents who, in one of the cases at least,
strongly urged his son not to proceed against the ground
officer, pointing out to him that an eviction might possibly
ensue, and that it was better even to suffer in character
and purse than run the risk of eviction from his holding
at the age of eighty. We have all heard of the doctrine
of visiting the sins of the parents upon the children, but
it has been left for Mr. Dugald Stuart of Lochcarron and
his ground officer, in the present generation&mdash;the highly-favoured
nineteenth century&mdash;to reverse all this, and to
punish the unoffending parents, for proceedings on the
part of their children which the Sheriff of the County and
all unprejudiced people who know the facts consider fully
justifiable.</p>

<p>“Now, so far as I can discover, after careful enquiry
among the men’s neighbours and in the village of Lochcarron,
nothing can be said against either of them.
Their characters are in every respect above suspicion.
The ground officer, whom I have seen, admits all this, and
makes no pretence that the eviction is for any other
reason than the conduct of the young men in prosecuting
and succeeding against himself in the Sheriff Court for
defamation of character. Maclean paid rent for his
present holding for the last sixty years, and never failed
to pay it on the appointed day. His father, grandfather,
and great-grandfather occupied the same place, and so
did their ancestors before them. Indeed, his grandfather
held one-half of the township, now occupied by
more than a hundred people. The old man is in his 81st
year, and bed-ridden&mdash;on his death-bed in fact&mdash;since
the middle of January last, he having then had a paralytic
stroke from which it is quite impossible he can ever<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
recover. It was most pitiable to see the aged and frail
human wreck as I saw him that day, and to have heard
him talking of the cruelty and hard-heartedness of those
who took advantage of the existing law to push him out
of the home which he has occupied so long, while he is
already on the brink of eternity. I quite agreed with
him, and I have no hesitation in saying that if Mr. Stuart
and his ground officer only called to see the miserable
old man, as I did, their hearts, however adamantine,
would melt, and they would at once declare to him that
he would be allowed to end his days, and die in peace,
under the roof which for generations had sheltered
himself and his ancestors. The wife is over 70 years of
age, and the frail old couple have no one to succour them
but the son who has been the cause, by defending his own
character, of their present misfortunes. Whatever Mr.
Stuart and his ground officer may do, or attempt to do,
the old man will not, and cannot be evicted until he is
carried to the churchyard; and it would be far more
gracious on their part to relent and allow the old man to
die in peace.</p>

<p>“Mackenzie has paid rent for over 40 years, and his
ancestors have done so for several generations before
him. He is nearly sixty years of age, and is highly
popular among his neighbours, all of whom are intensely
grieved at Mr. Stuart’s cruel and hard-hearted conduct
towards him and Maclean, and they still hope that he
will not proceed to extremities.</p>

<p>“The whole case is a lamentable abuse of the existing
law, and such as will do more to secure its abolition,
when the facts are fully known, than all the other cases of
eviction which have taken place in the Highlands during
the present generation. There is no pretence that the
case is anything else than a gross and cruel piece of retaliation
against the innocent parents for conduct on the
part of their sons which must have been very aggravating
to this proprietor and his ground officer, who appear to
think themselves fully justified in perpetuating such acts
of grossest cruelty and injustice.”</p>

<p>This report was slightly noticed at the time in the local<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
and Glasgow newspapers, and attention was thus directed
to Mr. Stuart’s proceedings. His whole conduct appeared
so cruelly tyrannical that most people expected
him to relent before the day of eviction arrived. But not
so; a sheriff officer and his assistants from Dingwall
duly arrived, and proceeded to turn Mackenzie’s furniture
out of his house. People congregated from all parts
of the district, some of them coming more than twenty
miles. The sheriff officer sent for the Lochcarron policemen
to aid him, but, notwithstanding, the law which
admitted of such unmitigated cruelty and oppression was
set at defiance; the sheriff officers were deforced, and the
furniture returned to the house by the sympathising
crowd. What was to be done next? The Procurator-Fiscal
for the county was Mr. Stuart’s law agent in carrying
out the evictions. How could he criminally prosecute
for deforcement in these circumstances? The Crown
authorities found themselves in a dilemma, and through
the tyranny of the proprietor on the one hand, and the
interference of the Procurator-Fiscal in civil business
which has ended in public disturbance and deforcement
of the Sheriff’s officers, on the other, the Crown authorities
found themselves helpless to vindicate the law. This is a
pity; for all right-thinking people have almost as little
sympathy for law breakers, even when that law is unjust
and cruel, as they have for those cruel landlords who, like
Mr. Stuart of Lochcarron, bring the law and his own order
into disrepute by the oppressive application of it against
innocent people. The proper remedy is to have the law
abolished, not to break it; and to bring this about such
conduct as that of Mr. Stuart and his ground officer is
more potent than all the Land Leagues and Reform Associations
in the United Kingdom.<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a></p>

<p>Mr. William Mackenzie of the <cite>Aberdeen Free Press</cite>, who
was on the ground, writes, next morning, after the deforcement
of the sheriff <span class="lock">officers:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>“During the encounter the local police constable drew
his baton, but he was peremptorily ordered to lay it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
down, and he did so. The officers then gave up the contest
and left the place about three in the morning.
Yesterday, before they left, and in course of the evening,
they were offered refreshments, but these they declined.
The people are this evening in possession as before.</p>

<p>“When every article was restored to its place, the song
and the dance were resumed, the native drink was freely
quaffed&mdash;for ‘freedom an’ whisky gang thegither’&mdash;the
steam was kept up throughout the greater part of yesterday,
and Mackenzie’s mantelpiece to-day is adorned with
a long tier of empty bottles, standing there as monuments
of the eventful night of the 29th-30th May, 1882.</p>

<div class="poetry-container" lang="gd" xml:lang="gd"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">

<p>“While these things were going on in the quiet township
of Slumbay, the Fiery Cross appears to have been
despatched over the neighbouring parishes; and from
Kintail, Lochalsh, Applecross, and even Gairloch, the
Highlanders began to gather yesterday with the view of
helping the Slumbay men, if occasion should arise. Few
of these reached Slumbay, but they were in small detachments
in the neighbourhood ready at any moment to
come to the rescue on the appearance of any hostile
force. After all the trains had come and gone for the
day, and as neither policemen nor Sheriff’s officers had
appeared on the scene, these different groups retired to
their respective places of abode. The Slumbay men, too,
resolved to suspend their festivities. A procession was
formed, and, being headed by the piper, they marched
triumphantly through Slumbay and Jeantown, and
escorted some of the strangers on their way to their
homes, returning to Slumbay in course of the night.”</p>

<p>As a contrast to Mr. Stuart’s conduct we are glad to
record the noble action of Mr. C. J. Murray, M.P. for
Hastings, who has, fortunately for the oppressed tenants
on the Lochcarron property, just purchased the estate.
He has made it a condition that Maclean and Mackenzie
shall be allowed to remain; and a further public scandal
has thus been avoided. This is a good beginning for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
new proprietor, and we trust to see his action as widely
circulated and commended as the tyrannical proceedings
of his predecessor have been condemned.</p>

<p>It is also fair to state what we know on the very best
authority, namely, that the factor on the estate, Mr.
Donald Macdonald, Tormore, strongly urged upon Mr.
Stuart not to evict these people, and that his own wife
also implored and begged of him not to carry out his cruel
and vindictive purpose. Where these agencies failed, it
is gratifying to find that Mr. Murray has succeeded;
and all parties&mdash;landlords and tenants&mdash;throughout the
Highlands are to be congratulated on the result.</p>

<h3>THE 78TH HIGHLANDERS.</h3>

<p>In connection with the evictions from the County of
Ross, the following will appropriately come in at this
stage. Referring to the glorious deeds of the 78th Highlanders
in India, under General Havelock, the editor of
the <cite>Northern Ensign</cite> writes:&mdash;All modern history, from
the rebellion in 1715, to the Cawnpore massacre of 1857,
teems with the record of Highland bravery and prowess.
What say our Highland evicting lairds to these facts,
and to the treatment of the Highlanders? What reward
have these men received for saving their country,
fighting its battles, conquering its enemies, turning the
tide of revolt, rescuing women and children from the
hands of Indian fiends, and establishing order, when
disorder and bloody cruelty have held their murderous
carnival? And we ask, in the name of men who have, ere
now, we fondly hope, saved our gallant countrymen
and heroic countrywomen at Lucknow; in the name of
those who fought in the trenches of Sebastopol, and
proudly planted the British standard on the heights of
the Alma, how are they, their fathers, brothers, and little
ones treated? Is the mere shuttle-cocking of an irrepressible
cry of admiration from mouth to mouth, and the
setting to music of a song in their praise, all the return
the race is to get for such noble acts? We can fancy the
expression of admiration of Highland bravery at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
Dunrobin dinner table, recently, when the dukes, earls,
lairds, and other aristocratic notables enjoyed the princely
hospitality of the Duke. We can imagine the mutual
congratulations of the Highland lairds as they prided
themselves on being proprietors of the soil which gave
birth to the race of “Highland heroes.” Alas, for the
blush that would cover their faces if they would allow
themselves to reflect that, in their names, and by their
authority, and at their expense, the fathers, mothers,
brothers, wives, of the invincible “78th” have been
remorselessly driven from their native soil; and that, at
the very hour when Cawnpore was gallantly retaken,
and the ruffian, Nana Sahib, was obliged to leave the
bloody scene of his fiendish massacre, there were Highlanders,
within a few miles of the princely Dunrobin,
driven from their homes and left to starve and to die in
the open field. Alas, for the blush that would reprint
its scarlet dye on their proud faces as they thought in
one county alone, since Waterloo was fought, more than
14,000 of this same “race of heroes” of whom Canning
so proudly boasted, have been hunted out of their
native homes; and that where the pibroch and the bugle
once evoked the martial spirit of thousands of brave
hearts, razed and burning cottages have formed the tragic
scenes of eviction and desolation; and the abodes of a
loyal and a liberty-loving people are made sacred to the
rearing of sheep, and sanctified to the preservation of
game! Yes; we echo back the cry, “Well done, brave
Highlanders!” But to what purpose would it be carried
on the wings of the wind to the once happy straths and
glens of Sutherland? Who, what, would echo back our
acclaims of praise? Perhaps a shepherd’s or a gillie’s
child, playing amid the unbroken wilds, and innocent
of seeing a human face but that of its own parents, would
hear it; or the cry might startle a herd of timid deer, or
frighten a covey of partridges, or call forth a bleat from a
herd of sheep; but men would not, could not, hear it.
We must go to the backwoods of Canada, to Detroit, to
Hamilton, to Woodstock, to Toronto, to Montreal; we
must stand by the waters of Lake Huron or Lake Ontario,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
where the cry&mdash;“Well done, brave Highlanders!” would
call up a thousand brawny fellows, and draw down a tear
on a thousand manly cheeks. Or we must go to the bare
rocks that skirt the sea-coast of Sutherland, where the
residuary population were generously treated to barren
steeps and inhospitable shores, on which to keep up the
breed of heroes, and fight for the men who dared&mdash;<em>dared</em>&mdash;to
drive them from houses for which they fought, and
from land which was purchased with the blood of their
fathers. But the cry, “Well done, brave Highlanders,”
would evoke no effective response from the race. Need
the reader wonder? Wherefore should they fight?
To what purpose did their fathers climb the Peninsular
heights and gloriously write in blood the superiority of
Britain, when their sons were rewarded by extirpation, or
toleration to starve, in sight of fertile straths and glens
devoted to beasts? These are words of truth and soberness.
They are but repetitions in other forms of arguments,
employed by us for years; and we shall continue
to ring changes on them so long as our brave Highland
people are subjected to treatment to which no other
race would have submitted. We are no alarmists. But
we tell Highland proprietors that were Britain some
twenty years hence to have the misfortune to be plunged
into such a crisis as the present, there will be few such
men as the Highlanders of the 78th to fight her battles,
and that the country will find when too late, if another
policy towards the Highlanders is not adopted, that sheep
and deer, ptarmigan and grouse, can do but little to save
it in such a calamity.</p>

<h3>THE REV. DR. JOHN KENNEDY ON THE
ROSS-SHIRE CLEARANCES.<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a></h3>

<p>Dr. John Kennedy, the highly, deservedly respected,
and eminent minister of Dingwall so long resident among
the scenes which he describes, and so intimately acquainted
with all classes of the people in his native<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
county of Ross, informs us that it was at a time when the
Highlanders became most distinguished as the most
peaceable and virtuous peasantry in the world&mdash;“at the
climax of their spiritual prosperity,” in Ross-shire&mdash;“that
the cruel work of eviction began to lay waste the
hill-sides and the plains of the North. Swayed by the
example of the godly among them, and away from the
influences by which less sequestered localities were
corrupted, the body of the people in the Highlands
became distinguished as the most peaceable and virtuous
peasantry in Britain. It was just then that they began
to be driven off by ungodly oppressors, to clear their
native soil for strangers, red deer, and sheep. With few
exceptions, the owners of the soil began to act as if they
were also owners of the people, and, disposed to regard
them as the vilest part of their estate, they treated them
without respect to the requirements of righteousness or
to the dictates of mercy. Without the inducement of
gain, in the recklessness of cruelty, families by hundreds
were driven across the sea, or gathered, as the sweepings
of the hill-sides, into wretched hamlets on the shore.
By wholesale evictions, wastes were formed for the red
deer, that the gentry of the nineteenth century might
indulge in the sports of the savages of three centuries
before. Of many happy households sheep walks were
cleared for strangers, who, fattening amidst the ruined
homes of the banished, corrupted by their example the
few natives who remained. Meanwhile their rulers,
while deaf to the Highlanders’ cry of oppression, were
wasting their sinews and their blood on battle-fields, that,
but for their prowess and their bravery, would have been
the scene of their country’s defeat.”</p>

<h3 class="nobreak">GLENGARRY.<br />

<span class="smcap">By</span> ALEXANDER MACKENZIE.</h3>

</div>

<p>Glengarry was peopled down to the end of last century
with a fine race of men. In 1745, six hundred stalwart<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
vassals followed the chief of Glengarry to the battle of
Culloden. Some few years later they became so disgusted
with the return made by their chief that many of them
emigrated to the United States, though they were almost
all in comfortable, some indeed, in affluent circumstances.
Notwithstanding this semi-voluntary exodus, Major John
Macdonell of Lochgarry, was able in 1777, to raise a fine
regiment&mdash;the 76th or Macdonald Highlanders&mdash;numbering
1086 men, 750 of whom were Highlanders mainly
from the Glengarry property. In 1794, Alexander Macdonnell
of Glengarry, raised a Fencible regiment, described
as “a handsome body of men,” of whom one-half
were enlisted on the same estate. On being disbanded
in 1802, these men were again so shabbily treated, that
they followed the example of the men of the “Forty-five,”
and emigrated in a body, with their families, to
Canada, taking two Gaelic-speaking ministers along with
them to their new home. They afterwards distinguished
themselves as part of the “Glengarry Fencibles” of
Canada, in defence of their adopted country, and called
their settlement there after their native glen in Scotland.
The chiefs of Glengarry drove away their people, only,
as in most other cases in the Highlands, to be themselves
ousted soon after them.</p>

<p>The Glengarry property at one time covered an area
of nearly 200 square miles, and to-day, while many of
their expatriated vassals are landed proprietors and in
affluent circumstances in Canada, not an inch of the old
possessions of the ancient and powerful family of Glengarry
remains to the descendants of those who caused the
banishment of a people who, on many a well-fought field,
shed their blood for their chief and country. In 1853,
every inch of the ancient heritage was possessed by the
stranger, except Knoydart in the west, and this has long
ago become the property of one of the Bairds. In the
year named, young Glengarry was a minor, his mother,
the widow of the late chief, being one of his trustees. She
does not appear to have learned any lesson of
wisdom from the past misfortunes of her
house. Indeed, considering her limited power and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
possessions, she was comparatively the worst of
them all.</p>

<p>The tenants of Knoydart, like all other Highlanders,
had suffered severely during and after the potato famine
in 1846 and 1847, and some of them got into arrear with a
year and some with two years’ rent, but they were fast
clearing it off. Mrs. Macdonell and her factor determined
to evict every crofter on her property, to make room for
sheep. In the spring of 1853, they were all served with
summonses of removal, accompanied by a message that
Sir John Macneil, chairman of the Board of Supervision,
had agreed to convey them to Australia. Their feelings
were not considered worthy of the slightest consideration.
They were not even asked whether they would prefer
to follow their countrymen to America and Canada.
They were to be treated as if they were nothing better
than Africans, and the laws of their country on a level
with those which regulated South American slavery.
The people, however, had no alternative but to accept any
offer made to them. They could not get an inch of land
on any of the neighbouring estates, and any one who would
give them a night’s shelter was threatened with eviction.</p>

<p>It was afterwards found not convenient to transport
them to Australia, and it was then intimated to the poor
creatures, as if they were nothing but common slaves to
be disposed of at will, that they would be taken to North
America, and that a ship would be at Isle Ornsay, in the
Isle of Skye, in a few days, to receive them, and that they
<em>must</em> go on board. The <i>Sillery</i> soon arrived. Mrs.
Macdonell and her factor came all the way from Edinburgh
to see the people hounded across in boats, and put
on board this ship whether they would or not. An eye-witness
who described the proceeding at the time, in a
now rare pamphlet, and whom we met a few years ago in
Nova Scotia, characterises the scene as heart-rending.
“The wail of the poor women and children as they were
torn away from their homes would have melted a heart of
stone.” Some few families, principally cottars, refused
to go, in spite of every influence brought to bear upon
them; and the treatment they afterwards received was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
cruel beyond belief. The houses, not only of those who
went, but of those who remained, were burnt and levelled
to the ground. The Strath was dotted all over with
black spots, showing where yesterday stood the habitations
of men. The scarred half-burned wood&mdash;couples,
rafters, cabars&mdash;were strewn about in every direction.
Stooks of corn and plots of unlifted potatoes could be
seen on all sides, but man was gone. No voice could be
heard. Those who refused to go aboard the <i>Sillery</i> were
in hiding among the rocks and the caves, while their
friends were packed off like so many African slaves to
the Cuban market.</p>

<p>No mercy was shown to those who refused to emigrate;
their few articles of furniture were thrown out of their
houses after them&mdash;beds, chairs, tables, pots, stoneware,
clothing, in many cases, rolling down the hill. What
took years to erect and collect were destroyed and scattered
in a few minutes. “From house to house, from
hut to hut, and from barn to barn, the factor and his
menials proceeded, carrying on the work of demolition,
until there was scarcely a human habitation left standing
in the district. Able-bodied men who, if the matter
would rest with a mere trial of physical force, would have
bound the factor and his party hand and foot, and sent
them out of the district, stood aside as dumb spectators.
Women wrung their hands and cried aloud, children ran
to and fro dreadfully frightened; and while all this work
of demolition and destruction was going on no opposition
was offered by the inhabitants, no hand was lifted, no
stone cast, no angry word was spoken.” The few huts
left undemolished were occupied by the paupers, but
before the factor left for the south even they were warned
not to give any shelter to the evicted, or their huts would
assuredly meet with the same fate. Eleven families,
numbering in all over sixty persons, mostly old and
decrepit men and women, and helpless children, were
exposed that night, and many of them long afterwards,
to the cold air, without shelter of any description beyond
what little they were able to save out of the wreck of
their burnt dwellings.</p>

<p>We feel unwilling to inflict pain on the reader by the
recitation of the untold cruelties perpetrated on the poor
Highlanders of Knoydart, but doing so may, perhaps,
serve a good purpose. It may convince the evil-doer
that his work shall not be forgotten, and any who may be
disposed to follow the example of past evictors may hesitate
before they proceed to immortalise themselves in
such a hateful manner. We shall, therefore, quote a
few cases from the pamphlet already referred <span class="lock">to:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>John Macdugald, aged about 50, with a wife and
family, was a cottar, and earned his subsistence chiefly by
fishing. He was in bad health, and had two of his sons in
the hospital, at Elgin, ill of smallpox, when the <i>Sillery</i>
was sent to convey the Knoydart people to Canada. He
refused to go on that occasion owing to the state of his
health, and his boys being at a distance under medical
treatment. The factor and the officers, however, arrived,
turned Macdugald and his family adrift, put their bits of
furniture out on the field, and in a few minutes levelled
their house to the ground. The whole family had now no
shelter but the broad canopy of heaven. The mother
and the youngest of the children could not sleep owing to
the cold, and the father, on account of his sickness, kept
wandering about all night near where his helpless family
lay down to repose. After the factor and the officers left
the district Macdugald and his wife went back to the
ruins of their house, collected some of the stones and turf
into something like walls, threw a few cabars across,
covered them over with blankets, old sails, and turf,
and then, with their children, crept underneath, trusting
that they would be allowed, at least for a time, to take
shelter under this temporary covering. But, alas!
they were doomed to bitter disappointment. A week
had not elapsed when the local manager, accompanied
by a <i>posse</i> of officers and menials, traversed the country
and levelled to the ground every hut or shelter erected by
the evicted peasantry. Macdugald was at this time
away from Knoydart; his wife was at Inverie, distant
about six miles, seeing a sick relative; the oldest children
were working at the shore; and in the hut, when the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
manager came with the “levellers,” he found none of the
family except Lucy and Jane, the two youngest. The
moment they saw the officers they screamed and fled for
their lives. The demolition of the shelter was easily
accomplished&mdash;it was but the work of two or three minutes;
and, this over, the officers and menials of the
manager amused themselves by seizing hold of chairs,
stools, tables, spinning-wheels, or any other light articles,
by throwing them a considerable distance from the hut.
The mother, as I said, was at Inverie, distant about six
or seven miles, and Lucy and Jane proceeded in that
direction hoping to meet her. They had not gone far,
however, when they missed the footpath and wandered
far out of the way. In the interval the mother returned
from Inverie and found the hut razed to the ground, her
furniture scattered far and near, her bedclothes lying
under turf, clay, and <i>debris</i>, and her children gone! Just
imagine the feelings of this poor Highland mother on the
occasion! But, to proceed, the other children returned
from the shore, and they too stood aside, amazed and
grieved at the sudden destruction of their humble refuge,
and at the absence of their two little sisters. At first
they thought they were under the ruins, and creeping
down on their knees they carefully removed every turf
and stone, but found nothing except a few broken dishes.
A consultation was now held and a search resolved upon.
The mother, brother and sisters set off in opposite directions,
among the rocks, over hills, through moor and moss,
searching every place, and calling aloud for them by
name, but they could discover no trace of them. Night
was now approaching and with it all hopes of finding
them, till next day, were fast dying away. The mother
was now returning “home” (alas! to what a <em>home</em>), the
shades of night closed in, and still she had about three
miles to travel. She made for the footpath, scrutinized
every bush, and looked round every rock and hillock,
hoping to find them. Sometimes she imagined that she
saw her two lasses walking before her at some short distance,
but it was an illusion caused by bushes just about
their size. The moon now emerged from behind a cloud<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
and spread its light on the path and surrounding district.
A sharp frost set in, and ice began to form on the little
pools. Passing near a rock and some bushes, where the
children of the tenants used to meet when herding the
cattle, she felt as if something beckoned her to search
there; this she did, and found her two little children
fast asleep, beside a favourite bush, the youngest with her
head resting on the breast of the eldest! Their own
version of their mishap is this: that when they saw the
officers they crept out and ran in the direction of
Inverie to tell their mother; that they missed the footpath,
then wandered about crying, and finally returned,
they knew not how, to their favourite herding ground, and
being completely exhausted, fell asleep. The mother
took the young one on her back, sent the other on before
her, and soon joined her other children near the ruins of
their old dwelling. They put a few sticks up to an old
fence, placed a blanket over it, and slept on the bare
ground that night. Macdugald soon returned from his
distant journey, found his family shelterless, and again
set about erecting some refuge for them from the wreck
of the old buildings. Again, however, the local manager
appeared with levellers, turned them all adrift, and
in a few moments pulled down and destroyed all that he
had built up. Matters continued in this way for a week
or two until Macdugald’s health became serious, and then
a neighbouring farmer gave him and his family temporary
shelter in an out-house; and for this act of disinterested
humanity he has already received some most improper
and threatening letters from the managers on the estate
of Knoydart. It is very likely that in consequence of this
interference Macdugald is again taking shelter among the
rocks or amid the wreck of his former residence.</p>

<p>John Mackinnon, a cottar, aged 44, with a wife and six
children, had his house pulled down, and had no place to
put his head in, consequently he and his family, for the
first night or two, had to burrow among the rocks near
the shore! When he thought that the factor and his
party had left the district, he emerged from the rocks,
surveyed the ruins of his former dwelling, saw his furni<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>ture
and other effects exposed to the elements, and now
scarcely worth the lifting. The demolition was so complete
that he considered it utterly impossible to make any
use of the ruins of the old house. The ruins of an old
chapel, however, were near at hand, and parts of the walls
were still standing; thither Mackinnon proceeded with
his family, and having swept away some rubbish and
removed some grass and nettles, they placed a few cabars
up to one of the walls, spread some sails and blankets
across, brought in some meadow hay, and laid it in a
corner for a bed, stuck a piece of iron into the wall in
another corner, on which they placed a crook, then
kindled a fire, washed some potatoes, and put a pot on
the fire, and boiled them, and when these and a few fish
roasted on the embers were ready, Mackinnon and his
family had <em>one</em> good diet, being the first regular meal
they tasted since the destruction of their house!</p>

<p>Mackinnon is a tall man, but poor and unhealthy-looking.
His wife is a poor weak women, evidently
struggling with a diseased constitution and dreadful
trials. The boys, Ronald and Archibald, were lying in
“bed”&mdash;(may I call a “pickle” hay on the bare ground a
bed?)&mdash;suffering from rheumatism and cholic. The
other children are apparently healthy enough as yet, but
very ragged. There is no door to their wretched abode,
consequently every breeze and gust that blow have free
ingress to the inmates. A savage from Terra-del-Fuego,
or a Red Indian from beyond the Rocky Mountains,
would not exchange huts with these victims, nor humanity
with their persecutors. Mackinnon’s wife was
pregnant when she was turned out of her house among the
rocks. In about four days after she had a premature
birth; and this and her exposure to the elements, and the
want of proper shelter and nutritious diet, has brought
on consumption from which there is no chance whatever
of her recovery.</p>

<p>There was something very solemn indeed in this scene.
Here, amid the ruins of the old sanctuary, where the
swallows fluttered, where the ivy tried to screen the grey
moss-covered stones, where nettles and grass grew up<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
luxuriously, where the floor was damp, the walls sombre
and uninviting, where there were no doors nor windows,
nor roof, and where the owl, the bat, and the fox used to
take refuge, a Christian family was obliged to take
shelter! One would think that as Mackinnon took refuge
amid the ruins of this most singular place, that he
would be let alone, that he would not any longer be
molested by man. But, alas! that was not to be. The
manager of Knoydart and his minions appeared, and invaded
this helpless family, even within the walls of the
sanctuary. They pulled down the sticks and sails he
set up within its ruins&mdash;put his wife and children out on
the cold shore&mdash;threw his tables, stools, chairs, etc.,
over the walls&mdash;burnt up the hay on which they slept&mdash;put
out the fire, and then left the district. Four times
have these officers broken in upon poor Mackinnon
in this way, destroying his place of shelter, and sent him
and his family adrift on the cold coast of Knoydart.
When I looked in upon these creatures last week I found
them in utter consternation, having just learned that the
officers would appear next day, and would again destroy
the huts. The children looked at me as if I had been a
wolf; they crept behind their father, and stared
wildly, dreading I was a law officer. The sight was most
painful. The very idea that, in Christian Scotland,
and in the nineteenth century, these tender infants
should be subjected to such gross treatment reflects
strongly upon our humanity and civilization. Had
they been suffering from the ravages of famine, or pestilence,
or war, I could understand it and account for it, but
suffering to gratify the ambition of some unfeeling
spectator in brute beasts, I think it most unwarranted,
and deserving the emphatic condemnation of every
Christian man. Had Mackinnon been in arrears of rent,
which he was not, even this would not justify the harsh,
cruel, and inhuman conduct pursued towards himself
and his family. No language of mine can describe the
condition of this poor family, exaggeration is impossible.
The ruins of an old chapel is the last place in the world
to which a poor Highlander would resort with his wife<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
and children, unless he was driven to it by dire necessity.
Take another case, that of</p>

<p>Elizabeth Gillies, a widow, aged 60 years. This is a
most lamentable case. Neither age, sex, nor circumstance
saved this poor creature from the most wanton and
cruel aggression. Her house was on the brow of a hill,
near a stream that formed the boundary between a large
sheep farm and the lands of the tenants of Knoydart.
Widow Gillies was warned to quit like the rest of the tenants,
and was offered a passage first to Australia and then
to Canada, but she refused to go, saying she could do
nothing in Canada. The widow, however, made no
promises, and the factor went away. She had then a
nice young daughter staying with her, but ere the vessel
that was to convey the Knoydart people away arrived
at Isle Ornsay, this young girl died, and poor Widow
Gillies was left alone. When the time for pulling down
the houses arrived, it was hoped that some mercy would
have been shown to this poor, bereaved widow, but there
was none. Widow Gillies was sitting inside her house
when the factor and officers arrived. They ordered her
to remove herself and effects instantly, as they were, they
said, to pull down the house! She asked them where she
would remove to; the factor would give no answer, but
continued insisting on her leaving the house. This she
at last positively refused. Two men then took hold of
her, and tried to pull her out by force, but she sat down
beside the fire, and would not move an inch. One of the
assistants threw water on the fire and extinguished it,
and then joined the other two in forcibly removing the
poor widow from the house. At first she struggled hard,
seized hold of every post or stone within her reach, taking
a death grasp of each to keep possession. But the officers
were too many and too cruel for her. They struck her
over the fingers, and compelled her to let go her hold, and
then all she could do was to greet and cry out murder!
She was ultimately thrust out at the door, from where she
crept on her hands and feet to a dyke side, being quite
exhausted and panting for breath, owing to her hard
struggle with three powerful men. Whenever they got<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
her outside, the work of destruction immediately commenced.
Stools, chairs, tables, cupboard, spinning-wheel,
bed, blankets, straw, dishes, pots, and chest,
were thrown out in the gutter. They broke down the
partitions, took down the crook from over the fire-place,
destroyed the hen roosts, and then beat the hens out
through the broad vent in the roof of the house. This
done, they set to work on the walls outside with picks
and iron levers. They pulled down the thatch, cut the
couples, and in a few minutes the walls fell out, while the
roof fell in with a dismal crash!</p>

<p>When the factor and his party were done with this
house, they proceeded to another district, pulling down
and destroying dwelling-places as they went along. The
shades of night at last closed in, and here was the poor
helpless widow sitting like a pelican, alone and cheerless.
Allan Macdonald, a cottar, whose house was also pulled
down, ran across the hill to see how the poor widow had
been treated, and found her moaning beside the dyke.
He led her to where his own children had taken shelter,
treated her kindly, and did all he could to comfort her
under the circumstances.</p>

<p>When I visited Knoydart I found the poor widow at
work, repairing her shed, and such a shed, and such a
dwelling, I never before witnessed. The poor creature
spoke remarkably well, and appeared to me to be a very
sensible woman. I expressed my sympathy for her, and
my disapprobation of the conduct of those who so unmercifully
treated her. She said it was indeed most
ungrateful on the part of the representatives of Glengarry
to have treated her so cruelly&mdash;that her predecessors
were, from time immemorial, on the Glengarry
estates&mdash;that many of them died in defence of, or fighting
for, the old chieftains&mdash;and that they had always been
true and faithful subjects. I asked why she refused to go
to Canada?</p>

<p>“For a very good reason,” she said, “I am now
old, and not able to clear a way in the forests of
Canada; and, besides, I am unfit for service; and, further,
I am averse to leave my native country, and rather<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
than leave it, I would much prefer that my grave was
opened beside my dear daughter, although I should be
buried alive!”</p>

<p>I do think she was sincere in what she said.
Despair and anguish were marked in her countenance,
and her attachment to her old habitation and its
associations were so strong that I believe they can only
be cut asunder by death! I left her in this miserable
shed which she occupied, and I question much if there
is another human residence like it in Europe. The wig-wam
of the wild Indian, or the cave of the Greenlander,
are palaces in comparison with it; and even the meanest
dog-kennel in England would be a thousand times more
preferable as a place of residence. If this poor Highland
woman will stand it out all winter in this abode it will be
indeed a great wonder. The factor has issued an <i>ukase</i>,
which aggravates all these cases of eviction with peculiar
hardship; he has warned all and sundry on the Knoydart
estates from receiving or entertaining the evicted
peasantry into their houses under pain of removal.</p>

<p>Allan Macdonald, aged 54, a widower, with four children,
was similarly treated. Our informant says of him:&mdash;“When
his late Majesty George IV. visited Scotland in
1823, and when Highland lairds sent up to Edinburgh
specimens of the bone and sinew&mdash;human produce&mdash;of
their properties, old Glengarry took care to give Allan
Macdonald a polite invitation to this ‘Royal exhibition.’
Alas! how matters have so sadly changed. Within the
last 30 years <em>man</em> has fallen off dreadfully in the estimation
of Highland proprietors. Commercially speaking,
Allan Macdonald has now no value at all. Had he been a
roe, a deer, a sheep, or a bullock, a Highland laird in
speculating could estimate his ‘real’ worth to within a
few shillings, but Allan is <em>only</em> a man. Then his children;
they are of no value, nor taken into account in the calculations
of the sportsman. They cannot be shot at like
hares, blackcocks, or grouse, nor yet can they be sent
south as game to feed the London market.”</p>

<p>Another case is that of Archibald Macisaac, crofter,
aged 66; wife 54, with a family of ten children.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
Archibald’s house, byre, barn, and stable were levelled
to the ground. The furniture of the house was
thrown down the hill, and a general destruction
then commenced. The roof, fixtures, and woodwork
were smashed to pieces, the walls razed to the
very foundation, and all that was left for poor Archibald
to look upon was a black dismal wreck. Twelve
human beings were thus deprived of their home in less
than half-an-hour. It was grossly illegal to have destroyed
the barn, for, according even to the law of
Scotland, the outgoing or removing tenant is entitled to
the use of the barn until his crops are disposed of. But,
of course, in a remote district, and among simple and
primitive people like the inhabitants of Knoydart, the
laws that concern them and define their rights are unknown
to them.</p>

<p>Archibald had now to make the best shift he could. No
mercy or favour could be expected from the factor.
Having convened his children beside an old fence where
he sat looking on when the destruction of his home was
accomplished, he addressed them on the peculiar nature of
the position in which they were placed, and the necessity
of asking for wisdom from above to guide them in any
future action. His wife and children wept, but the old
man said, “Neither weeping nor reflection will now avail;
we must prepare some shelter.” The children collected
some cabars and turf, and in the hollow between two
ditches, the old man constructed a rude shelter for the
night, and having kindled a fire and gathered in his
family, they all engaged in family worship and sung
psalms as usual. Next morning they examined the
ruins, picked up some broken pieces of furniture, dishes,
etc., and then made another addition to their shelter in
the ditch. Matters went on this way for about a week,
when the local manager and his men came down upon
them, and after much abuse for daring to take shelters
on the lands of Knoydart, they destroyed the shelter and
put old Archy and his people again out on the hill.</p>

<p>I found Archibald and his numerous family still at
Knoydart and in a shelter beside the old ditch. Any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
residence more wretched or more truly melancholy, I
have never witnessed. A feal, or turf erection, about
3 feet high, 4 feet broad, and about 5 feet long, was at the
end of the shelter, and this formed the sleeping place of
the mother and her five daughters! They creep in and
out on their knees, and their bed is just a layer of hay on
the cold earth of the ditch! There is surely monstrous
cruelty in this treatment of British females, and the laws
that sanction or tolerate such flagrant and gross abuses
are a disgrace to the Statute book and to the country
that permits it. Macisaac and his family are, so far as I
could learn, very decent, respectable, and well-behaved
people, and can we not perceive a monstrous injustice
in treating them worse than slaves because they refuse
to allow themselves to be packed off to the Colonies just
like so many bales of manufactured goods?</p>

<p>Again:&mdash;</p>

<p>Donald Maceachan, a cottar at Arar, married, with a
wife, and five children. This poor man, his wife, and
children were fully twenty-three nights without any
shelter but the broad and blue heavens. They kindled
a fire, and prepared their food beside a rock, and then
slept in the open air. Just imagine the condition of this
poor mother, Donald’s wife, nursing a delicate child, and
subjected to merciless storms of wind and rain during a
long October night. One of these melancholy nights
the blankets that covered them were frozen and white
with frost.</p>

<p>The next case is as follows;&mdash;</p>

<p>Charles Macdonald, aged 70 years, a widower, having
no family. This poor man was also “keeled” for the
Colonies, and, as he refused to go, his house or cabin was
levelled to the ground. What on earth could old Charles
do in America? Was there any mercy or humanity in
offering <em>him</em> a free passage across the Atlantic? In
England, Charles would have been considered a proper
object of parochial protection and relief, but in Scotland
no such relief is afforded except to “sick folks” and
tender infants. There can be no question, however, that
the factor looked forward to the period when Charles<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
would become chargeable as a pauper, and, acting as a
“prudent man,” he resolved to get quit of him at once.
Three or four pounds would send the old man across the
Atlantic, but if he remained in Knoydart, it would likely
take four or five pounds to keep him each year that he
lived. When the factor and his party arrived at Charles’s
door, they knocked and demanded admission; the factor
intimated his object, and ordered the old man to quit.
“As soon as I can,” said Charles, and, taking up his plaid
and staff and adjusting his blue bonnet, he walked out,
merely remarking to the factor that the man who could
turn out an old, inoffensive Highlander of seventy, from
such a place, and at such a season, could do a great deal
more if the laws of the country permitted him. Charles
took to the rocks, and from that day to this he has never
gone near his old habitation. He has neither house nor
home, but receives occasional supplies of food from his
evicted neighbours, <em>and he sleeps on the hill!</em> Poor old
man, who would not pity him&mdash;who would not share with
him a crust or a covering&mdash;who?</p>

<p>Alexander Macdonald, aged 40 years, with a wife and
family of four children, had his house pulled down. His
wife was pregnant; still the levellers thrust her out, and
then put the children out after her. The husband argued,
remonstrated, and protested, but it was all in vain; for
in a few minutes all he had for his (to him once comfortable)
home was a lot of rubbish, blackened rafters, and
heaps of stones. The levellers laughed at him and at his
protests, and when their work was over, moved away,
leaving him to find refuge the best way he could. Alexander
had, like the rest of his evicted brethren, to burrow
among the rocks and in caves until he put up a temporary
shelter amid the wreck of his old habitation, but from
which he was repeatedly driven away. For three days
Alexander Macdonald’s wife lay sick beside a bush, where,
owing to terror and exposure to cold, she had a miscarriage.
She was then removed to the shelter of the
walls of her former house, and for three days she lay so ill
that her life was despaired of. These are facts as to which
I challenge contradiction. I have not inserted them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
without the most satisfactory evidence of their
accuracy.</p>

<p>Catherine Mackinnon, aged about 50 years, unmarried;
Peggy Mackinnon, aged about 48 years, unmarried; and
Catherine Macphee (a half-sister of the two Mackinnons),
also unmarried; occupied one house. Catherine Mackinnon
was for a long time sick, and she was confined to
bed when the factor and his party came to beat down the
house. At first they requested her to get up and walk out,
but her sisters said she could not, as she was so unwell.
They answered, “Oh, she is scheming;” the sisters said
she was not, that she had been ill for a considerable
time, and the sick woman herself, who then feebly spoke,
said she was quite unfit to be removed, but if God spared
her and bestowed upon her better health that she would
remove of her own accord. This would not suffice;
<em>they forced her out of bed, sick as she was, and left her
beside a ditch from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.</em>, when, afraid that she
would die, as she was seriously unwell, they removed her
to a house and provided her with cordials and warm
clothing. Let the reader imagine the sufferings of this
poor female, so ruthlessly torn from a bed of sickness and
laid down beside a cold ditch and there left exposed for
seven long hours, and then say if such conduct does not
loudly call for the condemnation of every lover of human
liberty and humanity. Peggy and her half-sister Macphee
are still burrowing among the ruins of their old
home. When I left Knoydart last week there were no
hope whatever of Catherine Mackinnon’s recovery.</p>

<p>I challenge the factor to contradict one sentence in this
short narrative of the poor females. The melancholy
truth of it is too palpable, too well-known in the district
to admit of even a tenable explanation. Nothing can
palliate or excuse such gross inhumanity, and it is but
right and proper that British Christians should be made
aware of such unchristian conduct&mdash;such cruelty towards
helpless fellow-creatures in sickness and distress.</p>

<p>The last case, at present, is that of</p>

<p>Duncan Robertson, aged 35 years, with wife aged 32
years, and a family of three children. Very poor; the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
oldest boy is deformed and weak in mind and body, requiring
almost the constant care of one of his parents.
Robertson was warned out like the rest of the tenants,
and decree of removal was obtained against him. At the
levelling time the factor came up with his men before
Robertson’s door, and ordered the inmates out. Robertson
pleaded for mercy on account of his sick and imbecile
boy, but the factor appeared at first inexorable; at last
he sent in one of the officers to see the boy, who, on his
return, said that the boy was really and truly an object
of pity. The factor said he could not help it, that he must
pull down. Some pieces of furniture were then thrown
out, and the picks were fixed in the walls, when Robertson’s
wife ran out and implored delay, asking the factor,
for heaven’s sake, to come in and see her sick child.
He replied, “I am sure I am no doctor.” “I know that,”
she said, “but God might have given you Christian
feelings and bowels of compassion notwithstanding.”
“Bring him out here,” said the factor; and the poor
mother ran to the bed and brought out her sick boy in
her arms. When the factor saw him, he admitted that
he was an object of pity, but warned Robertson that he
must quit Knoydart as soon as possible, so that his house
would be pulled down about his ears. The levellers peep
in once a week to see if the boy is getting better, so that
the house may be razed.</p>

<p>We could give additional particulars of the cruelties
which had to be endured by the poor wretches who remained&mdash;cruelties
which would never be tolerated in any
other civilized country than Britain, and which in Britain
would secure instant and severe punishment if inflicted
on a dog or a pig, but the record would only inflict further
pain, and we have said enough.</p>

<p>Retribution has overtaken the evictors, and is it a
wonder that the chiefs of Glengarry are now as little
known, and own as little of their ancient domains in the
Highlands as their devoted clansmen? There is now
scarcely one of the name of Macdonald in the wide district
once inhabited by thousands. It is a huge wilderness in
which barely anything is met but wild animals and sheep,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
and the few keepers and shepherds necessary to take care
of them.</p>

<h3>STRATHGLASS.<br />

<span class="smcap">By</span> ALEXANDER MACKENZIE.</h3>

<p>It has been shown, under “Glengarry,” that a chief’s
widow, during her son’s minority, was responsible for the
Knoydart evictions in 1853. Another chief’s widow,
<i lang="gd" xml:lang="gd">Marsali Bhinneach</i>&mdash;Marjory, daughter of Sir Ludovick
Grant of Dalvey, widow of Duncan Macdonnell of Glengarry,
who died in 1788&mdash;gave the whole of Glencruaich
as a sheep farm to one south country shepherd, and to
make room for him she evicted over 500 people from their
ancient homes. The late Edward Ellice stated before a
Committee of the House of Commons, in 1873, that about
the time of the rebellion in 1745, the population of Glengarry
amounted to between 5000 and 6000. At the same
time the glen turned out an able-bodied warrior in support
of Prince Charles for every pound of rental paid to
the proprietor. To-day it is questionable if the same district
could turn out twenty men&mdash;certainly not that
number of Macdonalds. The bad example of this heartless
woman was unfortunately imitated afterwards by
her daughter Elizabeth, who, in 1795, married William
Chisholm of Chisholm, and to whose evil influence may
be traced the great eviction which, in 1801, cleared Strathglass
almost to a man of its ancient inhabitants. The
Chisholm was delicate, and often in bad health, so that the
management of the estate fell into the hands of his strong-minded
and hard-hearted wife. In 1801, no less than 799
took ship at Fort William and Isle Martin from Strathglass,
the Aird, Glen Urquhart, and the neighbouring
districts, all for Pictou, Nova Scotia; while in the following
year, 473 from the same district left Fort William,
for Upper Canada, and 128 for Pictou. Five hundred
and fifty went aboard another ship at Knoydart, many of
whom were from Strathglass. In 1803, four different
batches of 120 souls each, by four different ships, left<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
Strathglass, also for Pictou; while not a few went away
with emigrants from other parts of the Highlands. During
these three years we find that no less than 5390 were
driven out of these Highland glens, and it will be seen
that a very large portion of them were evicted from
Strathglass by the daughter of the notorious <i lang="gd" xml:lang="gd">Marsali
Bhinneach</i>. From among the living cargo of one of the
vessels which sailed from Fort William no less than fifty-three
souls died, on the way out, of an epidemic; and,
on the arrival of the living portion of the cargo at Pictou,
they were shut in on a narrow point of land, from whence
they were not allowed to communicate with any of their
friends who had gone before them, for fear of communicating
the contagion. Here they suffered indescribable
hardships.</p>

<p>By a peculiar arrangement between the Chisholm who
died in 1793, and his wife, a considerable portion of the
people were saved for a time from the ruthless conduct of
<i lang="gd" xml:lang="gd">Marsali Bhinneach’s</i> daughter and her co-adjutors.
Alexander Chisholm married Elizabeth, daughter of a Dr.
Wilson, in Edinburgh. He made provision for his wife in
case of her outliving him, by which it was left optional
with her to take a stated sum annually, or the rental of
certain townships, or club farms. Her husband died in
1793, when the estate reverted to his half-brother,
William, and the widow, on the advice of her only child,
Mary, who, afterwards became Mrs. James Gooden of
London, made choice of the joint farms, instead of the
sum of money named in her marriage settlement; and
though great efforts were made by <i lang="gd" xml:lang="gd">Marsali Bhinneach’s</i>
daughter and her friends, the widow, Mrs. Alexander
Chisholm, kept the farms in her own hands, and took
great pleasure in seeing a prosperous tenantry in these
townships, while all their neighbours were heartlessly
driven away. Not one of her tenants were disturbed or
interfered with in any way from the death of her husband,
in February 1793, until her own death in January, 1826,
when, unfortunately for them, their farms all came into
the hands of the young heir (whose sickly father died in
1817), and his cruel mother. For a few years the tenants<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
were left in possession, but only waiting an opportunity
to make a complete clearance of the whole Strath. Some
had a few years of their leases to run on other parts of the
property, and could not just then be expelled.</p>

<p>In 1830 every man who held land on the property was
requested to meet his chief at the local inn of Cannich.
They all obeyed, and were there at the appointed time,
but no chief came to meet them. The factor soon turned
up, however, and informed them that the laird had
determined to enter into no negotiation or any new arrangements
with them that day. They were all in good
circumstances, without any arrears of rent, but were
practically banished from their homes in the most
inconsiderate and cruel manner, and it afterwards became
known that their farms had been secretly let to
sheep farmers from the south, without the knowledge of
the native population in possession.</p>

<p>Mr. Colin Chisholm, who was present at the meeting at
Cannich, writes:&mdash;“I leave you to imagine the bitter
grief and disappointment of men who attended with glowing
hopes in the morning, but had to tell their families
and dependents in the evening that they could see no
alternative before them but the emigrant ship, and choose
between the scorching prairies of Australia and the icy
regions of North America.” It did not, however, come
to that. The late Lord Lovat, hearing of the harsh
proceedings, proposed to one of the large sheep farmers
on his neighbouring property to give up his farm, his lordship
offering to give full value for his stock, so that he
might divide it among those evicted from the Chisholm
estate. This arrangement was amicably carried through,
and at the next Whitsunday&mdash;1831&mdash;the evicted tenants
from Strathglass came into possession of the large sheep
farm of Glenstrathfarrar, and paid over to the late tenant
of the farm every farthing of the value set upon the stock
by two of the leading valuators in the country; a fact
which conclusively proved that the Strathglass tenants
were quite capable of holding their own, and perfectly able
to meet all claims that could be made upon them by their
old proprietor and unnatural chief. They became very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
comfortable in their new homes; but about fifteen years
after their eviction from Strathglass they were again
removed to make room for deer. On this occasion the
late Lord Lovat gave them similar holdings on other
portions of his property, and the sons and grandsons of the
evicted tenants of Strathglass are now, on the Lovat property,
among the most respectable and comfortable
middle-class farmers in the county.</p>

<p>The result of the Strathglass evictions was that only
two of the ancient native stock remained in possession of
an inch of land on the estate of Chisholm. When the
present Chisholm came into possession he found, on his
return from Canada, only that small remnant of his own
name and clan to receive him. He brought back a few
Chisholms from the Lovat property, and re-established
on his old farm a tenant who had been evicted nineteen
years before from the holding in which his father and
grandfather died. The great-grandfather was killed at
Culloden, having been shot while carrying his commander,
young Chisholm, mortally wounded, from the field. The
gratitude of that chief’s successors had been shown by his
ruthless eviction from the ancient home of his ancestors;
but it is gratifying to find the present chief making some
reparation by bringing back and liberally supporting the
representatives of such a devoted follower of his forbears.
The present Chisholm, who has the character of
being a good landlord, is descended from a distant collateral
branch of the family. The evicting Chisholms,
and their offspring have, however, every one of them,
disappeared, and Mr. Colin Chisholm informs us that there
is not a human being now in Strathglass of the descendants
of the chief, or of the south country farmers, who
were the chief instruments in evicting the native population.</p>

<p>To give the reader an idea of the class of men who
occupied this district, it may be stated that of the
descendants of those who lived in Glen Canaich, one of
several smaller glens, at one time thickly populated in the
Strath, but now a perfect wilderness&mdash;there lived in the
present generation, no less than three colonels, one major,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
three captains, three lieutenants, seven ensigns, one
bishop, and fifteen priests.</p>

<p>Earlier in the history of Strathglass and towards the
end of last century, an attempt was made by south country
sheep farmers to persuade Alexander Chisholm to
follow the example of Glengarry, by clearing out the whole
native population. Four southerners, among them
Gillespie, who took the farm of Glencruaich, cleared by
Glengarry, called upon the Chisholm, at Comar, and tried
hard to convince him of the many advantages which would
accrue to him by the eviction of his tenantry, and turning
the largest and best portions of his estate into great
sheep walks, for which they offered to pay him large
rents. His daughter, Mary, already referred to as Mrs.
James Gooden, was then in her teens. She heard the
arguments used, and having mildly expressed her objection
to the heartless proposal of the greedy southerners,
she was ordered out of the room, crying bitterly. She,
however, found her way to the kitchen, called all the servants
together, and explained the cause of her trouble.
The object of the guests at Comar was soon circulated
through the Strath, and early the following morning
over a thousand men met together in front of Comar
House, and demanded an interview with their chief.
This was at once granted, and the whole body of the
people remonstrated with him for entertaining, even for a
moment, the cruel proceedings suggested by the strangers,
whose conduct the frightened natives characterised
as infinitely worse than that of the freebooting Lochaber
men who, centuries before, came with their swords and
other instruments of death to rob his ancestors of their
patrimony, but who were defeated and driven out of the
district by the ancestors of those whom it was now proposed
to evict out of their native Strath, to make room
for the greedy freebooters of modern times and their
sheep. The chief counselled quietness, and suggested
that the action they had taken might be construed as
an act of inhospitality to his guests, not characteristic,
in any circumstances, of a Highland chief.</p>

<p>The sheep farmers who stood inside the open drawing-<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>room
window, heard all that had passed, and, seeing the
unexpected turn events were taking, and the desperate
resolve shown by the objects of their cruel purpose, they
adopted the better part of valour, slipped quietly out by
the back door, mounted their horses, galloped away as
fast as their steeds could carry them, and crossed the
river Glass among the hooting and derision of the assembled
tenantry, heard until they crossed the hill which
separates Strathglass from Corriemony. The result of
the interview with their laird was a complete understanding
between him and his tenants; and the flying horsemen,
looking behind them for the first time when they
reached the top of the Maol Bhuidhe, saw the assembled
tenantry forming a procession in front of Comar House,
with pipers at their head, and the Chisholm being carried,
mounted shoulder-high, by his stalwart vassals, on their
way to Invercannich. The pleasant outcome of the
whole was that chief and clan expressed renewed confidence
in each other, a determination to continue in future
in the same happy relationship, and to maintain, each on
his part, all modern and ancient bonds of fealty ever
entered into by their respective ancestors.</p>

<p>This, in fact, turned out to be one of the happiest days
that ever dawned on the glen. The people were left
unmolested so long as this Chisholm survived&mdash;a fact
which shows the wisdom of chief and people meeting face
to face, and refusing to permit others whether greedy
outsiders or selfish factors&mdash;to come and foment mischief
and misunderstanding between parties whose interests
are so closely bound together, and who, if they met and
discussed their differences, would seldom or ever have any
disagreements of a serious character. Worse counsel
prevailed after Alexander’s death, and the result under
the cruel daughter of the notorious <i lang="gd" xml:lang="gd">Marsali Bhinneach</i>,
has been already described.</p>

<p>Reference has been made to the clearance of Glenstrathfarrar
by the late Lord Lovat, but for the people
removed from there and other portions of the Lovat property,
he allotted lands in various other places on his
own estates, so that, although these changes were most<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
injurious to his tenants, his lordship’s proceedings can
hardly be called evictions in the ordinary sense of the
term. His predecessor, Archibald Fraser of Lovat,
however, evicted, like the Chisholms, hundreds from the
Lovat estates.</p>

<h3>GUISACHAN.<br />

<span class="smcap">By</span> ALEXANDER MACKENZIE.</h3>

<p>The modern clearances which took place within the
last quarter of a century in Guisachan, Strathglass, by
Sir Dudley Marjoribanks, have been described in all their
phases before a Committee of the House of Commons in
1872. The Inspector of Poor for the parish of Kiltarlity
wrote a letter which was brought before the Committee,
with a statement from another source that, “in 1855,
there were 16 farmers on the estate; the number of cows
they had was 62, and horses, 24; the principal farmer had
2000 sheep, the next 1000, and the rest between them
1200, giving a total of 4200. Now (1873) there is but one
farmer, and he leaves at Whitsunday; all these farmers
lost the holdings on which they ever lived in competency;
indeed, it is well known that some of them were able to
lay by some money. They have been sent to the four
quarters of the globe, or to vegetate in Sir Dudley’s
dandy cottages at Tomich, made more for show than convenience,
where they have to depend on his employment
or charity. To prove that all this is true, take at random,
the smith, the shoemaker, or the tailor, and say
whether the poverty and starvation were then or now?
For instance, under the old <i>régime</i>, the smith farmed a
piece of land which supplied the wants of his family
with meal and potatoes; he had two cows, a horse, and a
score or two of sheep on the hill; he paid £7 of yearly
rent; he now has nothing but the bare walls of his
cottage and smithy, for which he pays £10. Of course he
had his trade then as he has now. Will he live more comfortably
now than he did then?” It was stated, at the
same time, that, when Sir Dudley Marjoribanks bought<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
the property, there was a population of 255 souls upon it,
and Sir Dudley, in his examination, though he threw
some doubt upon that statement, was quite unable to
refute it. The proprietor, on being asked, said that he
did not evict any of the people. But Mr. Macombie
having said, “Then the tenants went away of their own
free will,” Sir Dudley replied, “I must not say so quite.
I told them that when they had found other places to go
to, I wished to have their farms.”</p>

<p>They were, in point of fact, evicted as much as any
others of the ancient tenantry in the Highlands, though
it is but fair to say that the same harsh cruelty was not
applied in their case as in many of the others recorded
in these pages. Those who had been allowed to remain
in the new cottages, are without cow or sheep, or an inch
of land, while those alive of those sent off are spread over
the wide world, like those sent, as already described,
from other places.</p>

<h3>GLENELG.<br />

<span class="smcap">By</span> ALEXANDER MACKENZIE.</h3>

<p>In 1849 more than 500 souls left Glenelg. These
petitioned the proprietor, Mr. Baillie of Dochfour, to
provide means of existence for them at home by means
of reclamation and improvements in the district, or, failing
this, to help them to emigrate. Mr. Baillie, after
repeated communications, made choice of the latter
alternative, and suggested that a local committee should
be appointed to procure and supply him with information
as to the number of families willing to emigrate, their
circumstances, and the amount of aid necessary to enable
them to do so. This was done, and it was intimated
to the proprietor that a sum of £3000 would be required
to land those willing to emigrate at Quebec. This sum
included passage money, free rations, a month’s sustenance
after the arrival of the party in Canada, and some
clothing for the more destitute. Ultimately, the proprietor
offered the sum of £2000, while the Highland<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
Destitution Committee promised £500. A great deal of
misunderstanding occurred before the <i>Liscard</i> finally
sailed, in consequence of misrepresentations made as
to the food to be supplied on board, while there were loud
protests against sending the people away without any
medical man in charge. Through the activity and generous
sympathy of the late Mr. Stewart of Ensay, then
tenant of Ellanreach, on the Glenelg property, who took
the side of the people, matters were soon rectified. A doctor
was secured, and the people satisfied as to the rations
to be served out to them during the passage, though
these did not come up to one-half what was originally
promised. On the whole, Mr. Baillie behaved liberally,
but, considering the suitability of the beautiful valley of
Glenelg for arable and food-producing purposes, it is to
be regretted that he did not decide upon utilizing the
labour of the natives in bringing the district into a state of
cultivation, rather than have paid so much to banish
them to a foreign land. That they would themselves
have preferred this is beyond question.</p>

<p>Mr. Mulock, father of the author of “John Halifax,
Gentleman,” an Englishman who could not be charged
with any preconceived prejudices or partiality for the
Highlanders, travelled at this period through the whole
North, and ultimately published an account of what he
had seen. Regarding the Glenelg business, he says, as
to their willingness to emigrate:&mdash;“To suppose that
numerous families would as a matter of choice sever themselves
from their loved soil, abolish all the associations
of local and patriotic sentiment, fling to the winds every
endearing recollection connected with the sojourneying
spot of vanished generations, and blot themselves, as it
were, out of the book of ‘home-born happiness,’ is an
hypothesis too unnatural to be encouraged by any sober,
well-regulated mind.” To satisfy himself, he called
forty to fifty heads of families together at Glenelg, who
had signed an agreement to emigrate, but who did not
find room in the <i>Liscard</i>, and were left behind, after
selling off everything they possessed, and were consequently
reduced to a state of starvation. “I asked,”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
he says, “these poor perfidiously treated creatures if,
notwithstanding all their hardships, they were willing
emigrants from their native land. With one voice they
assured me that nothing short of the impossibility of
obtaining land or employment at home could drive them
to seek the doubtful benefits of a foreign shore. So far
from the emigration being, at Glenelg, or Lochalsh, or
South Uist, a spontaneous movement springing out of the
wishes of the tenantry, I aver it to be, on the contrary,
the product of desperation, the calamitous light of hopeless
oppression visiting their sad hearts.” We have no
hesitation in saying that this is not only true of those to
whom Mr. Mulock specially refers, but to almost every
soul who have left the Highlands for the last sixty years.
Only those who know the people intimately, and the
means adopted by factors, clergy, and others to produce
an appearance of spontaneity on the part of the helpless
tenantry, can understand the extent to which this statement
is true. If a judicious system had been applied
of cultivating excellent land, capable of producing food in
abundance, in Glenelg, there was not another property in
the Highlands on which it was less necessary to send the
people away than in that beautiful and fertile valley.</p>

<h3>GLENDESSERAY AND LOCHARKAIG</h3>

<p>Great numbers were evicted from the Cameron country
of Lochaber, especially from Glendesseray and Locharkaig
side. Indeed it is said that there were so few
Camerons left in the district, that not a single tenant of
the name attended the banquet given by the tenantry
when the late Lochiel came into possession. The
details of Cameron evictions would be found pretty much
the same as those in other places, except that an attempt
has been made in this case to hold the factor entirely
and solely responsible for the removal of this noble people,
so renowned in the martial history of the country. That is
a question, however, which it is no part of our present
purpose to discuss. What we wish to expose is the unrighteous
system which allowed such cruel proceedings
to take place here and elsewhere, by landlord or factor.</p>

<span class="smcap">By</span> ALEXANDER MACKENZIE.</h2>

</div>

<p>The people of Skye and the Uist, where the Macdonalds
for centuries ruled in the manner of princes over a loyal
and devoted people, were treated not a whit better than
those on the mainland, when their services were no longer
required to fight the battles of the Lords of the Isles, or to
secure to them their possessions, their dignity, and power.
<i lang="gd" xml:lang="gd">Bha latha eile ann!</i> There was another day! When
possessions were held by the sword, those who wielded
them were highly valued, and well cared for. Now that
sheep skins are found sufficient, what could be more
appropriate in the opinion of some of the sheepish chiefs
of modern times than to displace the people who anciently
secured and held the lands for real chiefs worthy of the
name, and replace them by the animals that produced the
modern sheep skins by which they hold their lands;
especially when these were found to be better titles than
the old ones&mdash;the blood and sinew of their ancient vassals.</p>

<p>Prior to 1849, the manufacture of kelp in the Outer
Hebrides had been for many years a large source of income
to the proprietors of those islands, and a considerable
revenue to the inhabitants; the lairds, in consequence,
for many years encouraged the people to remain, and it is
alleged that they multiplied to a degree quite out of proportion
to the means of subsistence within reach when
kelp manufacture failed. To make matters worse for the
poor tenants, the rents were meanwhile raised by the proprietors
to more than double&mdash;not because the land was
considered worth more by itself, but because the possession
of it enabled the poor tenants to earn a certain sum
a year from kelp made out of the sea-ware to which their
holdings entitled them, and out of which the proprietor
pocketed a profit of from £3 to £4 per ton, in addition to
the enhanced rent obtained from the crofter for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
land. In these circumstances one would have thought
that some consideration would have been shown to the
people, who, it may perhaps be admitted, were found in
the altered circumstances too numerous to obtain a
livelihood in those islands; but such consideration does
not appear to have been given&mdash;indeed the very reverse.</p>

<h3>NORTH UIST.</h3>

<p>In 1849 Lord Macdonald determined to evict between
600 and 700 persons from Sollas, in North Uist, of which
he was then proprietor. They were at the time in a state
of great misery from the failure of the potato crop for
several years previously in succession, many of them
having had to work for ninety-six hours a week for a
pittance of two stones of Indian meal once a fortnight.
Sometimes even that miserable dole was not forthcoming,
and families had to live for weeks solely on shell-fish
picked up on the sea-shore. Some of the men were employed
on drainage works, for which public money was
advanced to the proprietors; but here, as in most other
places throughout the Highlands, the money earned was
applied by the factors to wipe off old arrears, while the
people were permitted generally to starve. His lordship
having decided that they must go, notices of ejectment
were served upon them, to take effect on the 15th of May,
1849. They asked for delay, to enable them to dispose
of their cattle and other effects to the best advantage at
the summer markets, and offered to work meanwhile
making kelp, on terms which would prove remunerative
to the proprietors, if only, in the altered circumstances,
they might get their crofts on equitable terms&mdash;for their
value, as such&mdash;apart from the kelp manufacture, on
account of which the rents had previously been raised.
Their petitions were ignored. No answers were received,
while at the same time they were directed to sow as much
corn and potatoes as they could during that spring, and
for which, they were told, they would be fully compensated,
whatever happened. They sold much of their
effects to procure seed, and continued to work and sow up<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
to and even after the 15th of May. They then began to
cut their peats as usual, thinking they were after all to be
allowed to get the benefit. They were, however, soon
disappointed&mdash;their goods were hypothecated. Many of
them were turned out of their houses, the doors locked,
and everything they possessed&mdash;cattle, crops, and peats&mdash;seized.
Even their bits of furniture were thrown out of
doors in the manner which had long become the fashion
in such cases. The season was too far advanced&mdash;towards
the end of July&mdash;to start for Canada. Before they
could arrive there the cold winter would be upon them,
without means or money to provide against it. They
naturally rebelled, and the principal Sheriff-Substitute,
Colquhoun, with his officers and a strong body of police
left Inverness for North Uist, to eject them from their
homes. Naturally unwilling to proceed to extremes, on
the arrival of the steamer at Armadale, they sent a messenger
ashore to ask for instructions to guide them in case
of resistance, or if possible to obtain a modification of his
lordship’s views. Lord Macdonald had no instructions
to give, but referred the Sheriff to Mr. Cooper, his factor,
whose answer was that the whole population of Sollas
would be subject to eviction if they did not at once agree
to emigrate. A few men were arrested who obstructed
the evictors on a previous occasion. They were marched
off to Lochmaddy by the police. The work of destruction
soon commenced. At first no opposition was made by
the poor people. An eye-witness, whose sympathies
were believed to be favourable to the proprietor, describes
some of the proceedings as <span class="lock">follows:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>“In evicting Macpherson, the first case taken up,
no opposition to the law officers was made. In
two or three minutes the few articles of furniture
he possessed&mdash;a bench, a chair, a broken chair,
a barrel, a bag of wool, and two or three small articles,
which comprised his whole household of goods and
gear&mdash;were turned out to the door, and his bothy
left roofless. The wife of the prisoner Macphail
(one of those taken to Lochmaddy on the previous day)
was the next evicted. Her domestic plenishing was of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
simplest character&mdash;its greatest, and by far its most
valuable part, being three small children, dressed in nothing
more than a single coat of coarse blanketing, who
played about her knee, while the poor woman, herself
half-clothed, with her face bathed in tears, and holding
an infant in her arms, assured the Sheriff that she and her
children were totally destitute and without food of any
kind. The Sheriff at once sent for the Inspector of Poor,
and ordered him to place the woman and her family on
the poor’s roll.”</p>

<p>The next house was occupied by very old and infirm
people, whom the Sheriff positively refused to evict. He
also refused to eject eight other families where an irregularity
was discovered by him in the notices served upon
them. The next family ejected led to the almost solitary
instance hitherto in the history of Highland evictions where
the people made anything like real resistance. This man
was a crofter and weaver, having a wife and nine children
to provide for. At this stage a crowd of men and women
gathered on an eminence a little distance from the house,
and gave the first indications of a hostile intention by
raising shouts, as the police advanced to help in the work
of demolition, accompanied by about a dozen men who
came to their assistance in unroofing the houses from the
other end of the island. The crowd, exasperated at the
conduct of their own neighbours, threw some stones at
the latter. The police were then drawn up in two lines.
The furniture was thrown outside, the web was cut of the
loom, and the terrified woman rushed to the door with a
infant in her arms, exclaiming in a passionate and wailing
voice&mdash;“<span lang="gd" xml:lang="gd">Tha mo chlann air a bhi’ air a muirt</span>” (My
children are to be murdered). The crowd became excited,
stones were thrown at the officers, their assistants were
driven from the roof of the house, and they had to retire
behind the police for shelter. Volleys of stones and other
missiles followed. The police charged in two divisions.
There were some cuts and bruises on both sides. The
work of demolition was then allowed to go on without
further opposition from the crowd.</p>

<p>Several heart-rending scenes followed, but we shall only<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
give a description of the last which took place on that
occasion, and which brought about a little delay in the
cruel work. In one case it was found necessary to remove
the women out of the house by force. “One of them
threw herself upon the ground and fell into hysterics,
uttering the most doleful sounds, and barking and yelling
like a dog for about ten minutes. Another, with many
tears, sobs, and groans put up a petition to the Sheriff
that they would leave the roof over part of her house,
where she had a loom with cloth in it, which she was
weaving; and a third woman, the eldest of the family,
made an attack with a stick on an officer, and, missing
him, she sprang upon him, and knocked off his hat. So
violently did this old woman conduct herself that two
stout policemen had great difficulty in carrying her outside
the door. The excitement was again getting so
strong that the factor, seeing the determination of the
people, and finding that if he continued and took their
crops away from those who would not leave, even when
their houses were pulled down about their ears, they
would have to be fed and maintained at the expense of
the parish during the forthcoming winter, relaxed and
agreed to allow them to occupy their houses until next
spring, if the heads of families undertook and signed an
agreement to emigrate any time next year, from the 1st
of February to the end of June. Some agreed to these
conditions, but the majority declined; and, in the circumstances,
the people were permitted to go back to their
unroofed and ruined homes for a few months longer.
Their cattle were, however, mostly taken possession of,
and applied to the reduction of old arrears.”</p>

<p>Four of the men were afterwards charged with deforcing
the officers, and sentenced at Inverness Court of
Justiciary each to four months’ imprisonment. The following
year the district was completely and mercilessly
cleared of all its remaining inhabitants, numbering 603
souls.<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span></p>
<p>The Sollas evictions did not satisfy the evicting craze
which his lordship afterwards so bitterly regretted. In
1851-53, he, or rather his trustee, determined to evict the
people from the villages of</p>

<h3>BORERAIG AND SUISINISH, ISLE OF SKYE.</h3>

<p>His lordship’s position in regard to the proceedings was
most unfortunate. Donald Ross, writing as an eye-witness
of these evictions, says&mdash;</p>

<p>“Some years ago Lord Macdonald incurred debts
on his property to the extent of £200,000 sterling,
and his lands being entailed, his creditors could
not dispose of them, but they placed a trustee
over them in order to intercept certain portions
of the rent in payment of the debt. Lord Macdonald,
of course, continues to have an interest and a surveillance
over the property in the matter of removals,
the letting of the fishings and shootings, and the general
improvement of his estates. The trustee and the local
factor under him have no particular interest in the property,
nor in the people thereon, beyond collecting their
quota of the rents for the creditors; consequently the
property is mismanaged, and the crofter and cottar population
are greatly neglected. The tenants of Suisinish
and Boreraig were the descendants of a long line of
peasantry on the Macdonald estates, and were remarkable
for their patience, loyalty, and general good conduct.”</p>

<p>The only plea made at the time for evicting them was
that of over-population. Ten families received the usual
summonses, and passages were secured for them in the
<i>Hercules</i>, an unfortunate ship which sailed with a cargo
of passengers under the auspices of a body calling itself
“The Highland and Island Emigration Society.” A
deadly fever broke out among the passengers, the ship was
detained at Cork in consequence, and a large number
of the passengers died of the epidemic. After the sad
fate of so many of those previously cleared out, in the
ill-fated ship, it was generally thought that some compassion
would be shown for those who had been still<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
permitted to remain. Not so, however. On the 4th of
April, 1853, they were all warned out of their holdings.
They petitioned and pleaded with his lordship to no purpose.
They were ordered to remove their cattle from
the pasture, and themselves from their houses and lands.
They again petitioned his lordship for his merciful consideration.
For a time no reply was forthcoming.
Subsequently, however, they were informed that they
would get land on another part of the estate&mdash;portions
of a barren moor, quite unfit for cultivation.</p>

<p>In the middle of September following, Lord Macdonald’s
ground officer, with a body of constables, arrived,
and at once proceeded to eject in the most heartless
manner the whole population, numbering thirty-two
families, and that at a period when the able-bodied male
members of the families were away from home trying to
earn something by which to pay their rents, and help to
carry their families through the coming winter. In
spite of the wailing of the helpless women and children,
the cruel work was proceeded with as rapidly as possible,
and without the slightest apparent compunction. The
furniture was thrown out in what had now become the
orthodox fashion. The aged and infirm, some of them
so frail that they could not move, were pushed or carried
out. “The scene was truly heart-rending. The women
and children went about tearing their hair, and rending
the heavens with their cries. Mothers with tender infants
at the breast looked helplessly on, while their effects
and their aged and infirm relatives, were cast out, and the
doors of their houses locked in their faces.” The young
children, poor, helpless, little creatures, gathered in
groups, gave vent to their feelings in loud and bitter
wailings. “No mercy was shown to age or sex, all
were indiscriminately thrust out and left to perish on the
hills.” Untold cruelties were perpetrated on this occasion
on the helpless creatures during the absence of their
husbands and other principal bread-winners.</p>

<p>Donald Ross in his pamphlet, “Real Scottish
Grievances,” published in 1854, and who not only was
an eye-witness, but generously supplied the people with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
a great quantity of food and clothing, describes several
of the cases. I can only find room here, however, for
his first.</p>

<p>Flora Robertson or Matheson, a widow, aged ninety-six
years, then residing with her son, Alexander Matheson,
who had a small lot of land in Suisinish. Her son was a
widower, with four children; and shortly before the time
for evicting the people arrived, he went away to labour
at harvest in the south, taking his oldest boy with him.
The grandmother and the other three children were left in
the house. “When the evicting officers and factor arrived,
the poor old woman was sitting on a couch outside
the house. The day being fine, her grandchildren lifted
her out of her bed and brought her to the door. She was
very frail; and it would have gladdened any heart to
have seen how the two youngest of her grandchildren
helped her along; how they seated her where there was
most shelter; and then, how they brought her some clothing
and clad her, and endeavoured to make her comfortable.
The gratitude of the old woman was unbounded
at these little acts of kindness and compassion; and the
poor children, on the other hand, felt highly pleased at
finding their services so well appreciated. The sun was
shining beautifully, the air was refreshing, the gentle
breeze wafted across the hills, and, mollified by passing
over the waters of Loch Slapin, brought great relief and
vigour to poor old Flora. Often with eyes directed towards
heaven, and with uplifted hands, did she invoke the
blessings of the God of Jacob on the young children who
were ministering so faithfully to her bodily wants.</p>

<p>Nothing could exceed the beauty of the scene. The sea
was glittering with millions of little waves and globules,
and looked like a lake of silver, gently agitated. The
hills, with the heather in full bloom, and with the wild
flowers in their beauty, had assumed all the colours of the
rainbow, and were most pleasant to the eye to look
upon. The crops of corn in the neighbourhood were
beginning to get yellow for the harvest; the small
patches of potatoes were under flower, and promised well;
the sheep and cattle, as if tired of feeding, had lain down<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
to rest on the face of the hills; and the dogs, as if satisfied
their services were not required for a time, chose for
themselves pleasant, well-sheltered spots and lay basking
at full length in the sun. Even the little boats on the loch,
though their sails were spread, made no progress, but
lay at rest, reflecting their own tiny shadows on the
bosom of the deep and still waters. The scene was most
enchanting; and, although old Flora’s eyes were getting
dim with age, she looked on the objects before her with
great delight. Her grandchildren brought her a cup of
warm milk and some bread from a neighbour’s house, and
tried to feed her as if she had been a pet bird; but the
old woman could not take much, although she was greatly
invigorated by the change of air. Nature seemed to take
repose. A white fleecy cloud now and then ascended,
but the sun soon dispelled it; thin wreaths of cottage
smoke went up and along, but there was no wind to move
them, and they floated on the air; and, indeed, with the
exception of a stream which passed near the house, and
made a continuous noise in its progress over rocks and
stones, there was nothing above or around to disturb the
eye or the ear for one moment. While the old woman
was thus enjoying the benefit of the fresh air, admiring
the beauty of the landscape, and just when the poor children
had entered the house to prepare a frugal meal for
themselves, and their aged charge, a sudden barking of
dogs gave signal intimation of the approach of strangers.
The native inquisitiveness of the young ones was immediately
set on edge, and off they set across the fields,
and over fences, after the dogs. They soon returned,
however, with horror depicted in their countenances;
they had a fearful tale to unfold. The furniture and other
effects of their nearest neighbours, just across the hill,
they saw thrown out; they heard the children screaming,
and they saw the factor’s men putting bars and locks on
the doors. This was enough. The heart of the old
woman, so recently revived and invigorated, was now like
to break within her. What was she to do? What could
she do? Absolutely nothing! The poor children, in the
plenitude of their knowledge of the humanity of lords and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
factors, thought that if they could only get their aged
grannie inside before the evicting officers arrived, that
would be safe,&mdash;as no one, they thought, would interfere
with an old creature of ninety-six, especially when her
son was not there to take charge of her; and, acting
upon this supposition, they began to remove their grandmother
into the house. The officers, however, arrived
before they could get this accomplished; and in place of
letting the old woman in, they threw out before the door
every article that was inside the house, and then they
placed large bars and padlocks on the door! The grandchildren
were horror-struck at this procedure&mdash;and no
wonder. Here they were, shut out of house and home,
their father and elder brother several hundred miles
away from them, their mother dead, and their grandmother,
now aged, frail, and unable to move, sitting before
them, quite unfit to help herself,&mdash;and with no other
shelter than the broad canopy of heaven. Here, then,
was a crisis, a predicament, that would have twisted the
strongest nerve and tried the stoutest heart and healthiest
frame,&mdash;with nothing but helpless infancy and old
age and infirmities to meet it. We cannot comprehend
the feelings of the poor children on this occasion; and
cannot find language sufficiently strong to express
condemnation of those who rendered them houseless.
Shall we call them savages? That would be paying them
too high a compliment, for among savages conduct such
as theirs is unknown. But let us proceed. After the
grandchildren had cried until they were hoarse, and after
their little eyes had emptied themselves of the tears
which anguish, sorrow, and terror had accumulated within
them, and when they had exhausted their strength in the
general wail, along with the other children of the district,
as house after house was swept of its furniture, the inmates
evicted, and the doors locked,&mdash;they returned to
their poor old grandmother, and began to exchange
sorrows and consolations with her. But what could the
poor children do? The shades of evening were closing
in, and the air, which at mid-day was fresh and balmy,
was now cold and freezing. The neighbours were all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
locked out, and could give no shelter, and the old woman
was unable to travel to where lodgings for the night could
be got. What were they to do? We may rest satisfied
that their minds were fully occupied with their unfortunate
condition, and that they had serious consultations
as to future action. The first consideration, however,
was shelter for the first night, and a sheep-cot
being near, the children prepared to remove the old
woman to it. True, it was small and damp, and it had
no door, no fire-place, no window, no bed,&mdash;but then, it
was better than exposure to the night air; and this they
represented to their grandmother, backing it with all the
other little bits of arguments they could advance, and
with professions of sincere attachment which, coming
from such a quarter, and at such a period, gladdened her
old heart. There was a difficulty, however, which they
at first overlooked. The grandmother could not walk,
and the distance was some hundreds of yards, and they
could get no assistance, for all the neighbours were
similarly situated, and were weeping and wailing for the
distress which had come upon them. Here was a
dilemma; but the children helped the poor woman to
creep along, sometimes she walked a few yards, at other
times she crawled on her hands and knees, and in this
way, and most materially aided by her grandchildren,
she at last reached the cot.</p>

<p>The sheep-cot was a most wretched habitation, quite
unfit for human beings, yet here the widow was compelled
to remain until the month of December following.
When her son came home from the harvest in the south,
he was amazed at the treatment his aged mother and his
children had received. He was then in good health;
but in a few weeks the cold and damp of the sheep-cot
had a most deadly effect upon his health, for he was seized
with violent cramps, then with cough; at last his limbs
and body swelled, and then he died! When dead, his
corpse lay across the floor, his feet at the opposite wall,
and his head being at the door, the wind waved his long
black hair to and fro until he was placed in his coffin.</p>

<p>The inspector of poor, who, be it remembered, was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
ground officer to Lord Macdonald, and also acted as the
chief officer in the evictions, at last appeared, and removed
the old woman to another house; not, however,
until he was threatened with a prosecution for neglect of
duty. The grandchildren were also removed from the
sheep-cot, for they were ill; Peggy and William were
seriously so, but Sandy, although ill, could walk a little.
The inspector for the poor gave the children, during their
illness, only 14 lbs. of meal and 3 lbs. of rice, as aliment
for three weeks, and nothing else. To the grandmother
he allowed two shillings and sixpence per month, but
made no provision for fuel, lodgings, nutritious diet, or
cordials&mdash;all of which this old woman much required.</p>

<p>When I visited the house where old Flora Matheson
and her grandchildren reside, I found her lying on a
miserable pallet of straw, which, with a few rags of clothing,
are on the bare floor. She is reduced to a skeleton,
and from her own statement to me, in presence of witnesses,
coupled with other inquiries and examinations,
I have no hesitation in declaring that she was then
actually starving. She had no nourishment, no cordials,
nothing whatever in the way of food but a few wet potatoes
and two or three shell-fish. The picture she presented,
as she lay on her wretched pallet of black rags
and brown straw, with her mutch as black as soot, and
her long arms thrown across, with nothing on them but
the skin, was a most lamentable one&mdash;and one that reflects
the deepest discredit on the parochial authorities
of Strath. There was no one to attend to the wants or
infirmities of this aged pauper but her grandchild, a
young girl, ten years of age. Surely in a country boasting
of its humanity, liberty, and Christianity, such conduct
should not be any longer tolerated in dealing with the
infirm and helpless poor. The pittance of 2s. 6d. a month
is but a mockery of the claims of this old woman; it is
insulting to the commonsense and every-day experience
of people of feeling, and it is a shameful evasion of the
law. But for accidental charity, and that from a distance,
Widow Matheson would long ere this have perished
of starvation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span></p>

<p>Three men were afterwards charged with deforcing the
officers of the law before the Court of Justiciary at Inverness.
They were first imprisoned at Portree, and afterwards
marched on foot to Inverness, a distance of over a
hundred miles, where they arrived two days before the
date of their trial. The factor and sheriff-officers came
in their conveyances, at the public expense, and lived
right royally, never dreaming but they would obtain a
victory, and get the three men sent to the Penitentiary,
to wear hoddy, break stones, or pick oakum for at least
twelve months. The accused, through the influence of
charitable friends, secured the services of Mr. Rennie,
solicitor, Inverness, who was able to show to the jury
the unfounded and farcical nature of the charges made
against them. His eloquent and able address to the jury
in their behalf was irresistible, and we cannot better
explain the nature of the proceedings than by quoting
it in part from the report given of it, at the time, in the
<cite>Inverness Advertiser</cite>:&mdash;</p>

<p>“Before proceeding to comment on the evidence in
this case, he would call attention to its general features.
It was one of a fearful series of ejectments now being
carried through in the Highlands; and it really became a
matter of serious reflection, how far the pound of flesh
allowed by law was to be permitted to be extracted from
the bodies of the Highlanders. Here were thirty-two
families, averaging four members each, or from 130 to
150 in all, driven out from their houses and happy
homes, and for what? For a tenant who, he believed,
was not yet found. But it was the will of Lord Macdonald
and of Messrs. Brown and Ballingal, that they
should be ejected; and the civil law having failed them,
the criminal law with all its terrors, is called in to overwhelm
these unhappy people. But, thank God, it has
come before a jury&mdash;before you, who are sworn to return,
and will return, an impartial verdict; and which verdict
will, I trust, be one that will stamp out with ignominy the
cruel actors in it. The Duke of Newcastle had querulously
asked, ‘Could he not do as he liked with his own?’ but
a greater man had answered, that ‘property had its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
duties as well as its rights,’ and the concurrent opinion
of an admiring age testified to this truth. Had the factor
here done his duty? No! He had driven the miserable
inhabitants out to the barren heaths and wet mosses.
He had come with the force of the civil power to dispossess
them, and make way for sheep and cattle. But
had he provided adequate refuge? The evictions in
Knoydart, which had lately occupied the attention of the
press and all thinking men, were cruel enough; but there
a refuge was provided for a portion of the evicted, and
ships for their conveyance to a distant land. Would
such a state of matters be tolerated in a country where a
single spark of Highland spirit existed? No! Their
verdict that day would proclaim, over the length and
breadth of the land, an indignant denial. Approaching
the present case more minutely, he would observe that
the prosecutor, by deleting from this libel the charge of
obstruction, which was passive, had cut away the ground
from under his feet. The remaining charge of deforcement
being active, pushing, shoving, or striking, was
essential. But he would ask, What was the character of
the village, and the household of Macinnes? There were
mutual remonstrances; but was force used? The only
things the officer, Macdonald, seized were carried out. A
spade and creel were talked of as being taken from him,
but in this he was unsupported. The charge against the
panel, Macinnes, only applied to what took place inside
his house. As to the other panels, John Macrae was
merely present. He had a right to be there; but he
touched neither man nor thing, and he at any rate must
be acquitted. Even with regard to Duncan Macrae, the
evidence <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">quoad</i> him was contemptible. According to
Allison, in order to constitute the crime of deforcement,
there must be such violence as to intimidate a person of
ordinary firmness of character. Now, there was no violence
here, they did not even speak aloud, they merely
stood in the door; that might be obstruction, it was
certainly not deforcement. Had Macdonald, who it
appeared combined in his single person the triple offices
of sheriff-officer, ground-officer, and inspector of poor,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
known anything of his business, and gone about it in a
proper and regular manner, the present case would never
have been heard of. As an instance of his irregularity,
whilst his execution of deforcement bore that he read his
warrants, he by his own mouth, stated that he only read
part of them. Something was attempted to be made of
the fact of Duncan Macrae seizing one of the constables
and pulling him away; but this was done in a good-natured
manner, and the constable admitted he feared
no violence. In short, it would be a farce to call this a
case of deforcement. As to the general character of the
panels, it was unreproached and irreproachable, and their
behaviour on that day was their best certificate.”</p>

<p>The jury immediately returned a verdict of “Not
guilty,” and the poor Skyemen were dismissed from the
bar, amid the cheers of an Inverness crowd. The families
of these men were at the next Christmas evicted in the
most spiteful and cruel manner, delicate mothers, half-dressed,
and recently-born infants, having been pushed
out into the drifting snow. Their few bits of furniture,
blankets and other clothing lay for days under the snow,
while they found shelter themselves as best they could in
broken-down, dilapidated out-houses and barns. These
latter proceedings were afterwards found to have been
illegal, the original summonses, on which the second proceedings
were taken, having been exhausted in the previous
evictions, when the Macinneses and the Macraes
were unsuccessfully charged with deforcing the sheriff-officers.
The proceedings were universally condemned
by every right-thinking person who knew the district,
as quite uncalled for, most unjustifiable and improper,
as well as for “the reckless cruelty and inhumanity with
which they were carried through.” Yet, the factor issued
a circular in defence of such horrid work in which he
coolly informed the public that these evictions were
“prompted by motives of benevolence, piety, and humanity,”
and that the cause for them all was “because
they (the people) were too far from Church.” Oh God!
what crimes have been committed in Thy name, and in
that of religion! Preserve us from such piety and hu<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>manity
as were exhibited by Lord Macdonald and his
factor on this and other occasions.</p>

<h3>A CONTRAST.</h3>

<p>Before leaving Skye, it will be interesting to see the
difference of opinion which existed among the chiefs
regarding the eviction of the people at this period and a
century earlier. We have just seen what a Lord Macdonald
has done in the present century, little more than thirty
years ago. Let us compare his proceedings and feelings
to those of his ancestor, in 1739, a century earlier. In
that year a certain Norman Macleod managed to get some
islanders to emigrate, and it was feared that Government
would hold Sir Alexander Macdonald of Sleat responsible,
as he was reported to have encouraged Macleod.</p>

<p>The baronet being from home, his wife, Lady Margaret,
wrote to Lord Justice-Clerk Milton on the 1st of January,
1740, pleading with him to use all his influence against a
prosecution of her husband, which, “tho’ it cannot be
dangerouse to him, yett it cannot faill of being both
troublesome and expensive.” She begins her letter by
stating that she was informed “by different hands
from Edinburgh that there is a currant report of a
ship’s haveing gone from thiss country with a greate
many people designed for America, and that Sir Alexander
is thought to have concurred in forceing these
people away.” She then declares the charge against her
husband to be “a falsehood,” but she “is quite acquainted
with the danger of a report” of that nature.
Instead of Sir Alexander being a party to the proceedings
of this “Norman Macleod, with a number of fellows that
he had picked up execute his intentions,” he “was both
angry and concern’d to hear that some of his oune people
were taken in thiss affair.”</p>

<p>What a contrast between the sentiments here
expressed and those which carried out the modern
evictions! And yet it is well-known that, in other
respects no more humane man ever lived than he
who was nominally responsible for the cruelties in Skye<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
and at Sollas. He allowed himself to be imposed upon by
others, and completely abdicated his high functions as
landlord and chief of his people. We have the most
conclusive testimony and assurance from one who knew
his lordship intimately, that, to his dying day, he never
ceased to regret what had been done in his name, and at
the time, with his tacit approval, in Skye and in North

<h3>SOUTH UIST AND BARRA.</h3>

<p>Napoleon Bonaparte, at one time, took 500 prisoners
and was unable to provide food for them. Let them go he
would not, though he saw that they would perish by
famine. His ideas of mercy suggested to him to have
them all shot. They were by his orders formed into a
square, and 2000 French muskets with ball cartridge
was simultaneously levelled at them, which soon put the
disarmed mass of human beings out of pain. Donald
Macleod refers to this painful act as <span class="lock">follows:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>“All the Christian nations of Europe were horrified,
every breast was full of indignation at the perpetrator
of this horrible tragedy, and France wept
bitterly for the manner in which the tender mercies
of their wicked Emperor were exhibited. Ah! but
guilty Christians, you Protestant law-making Britain,
tremble when you look towards the great day of
retribution. Under the protection of your law,
Colonel Gordon has consigned 1500 men, women, and
children, to a death a hundred-fold more agonising and
horrifying. With the sanction of your law he (Colonel
Gordon) and his predecessors, in imitation of his Grace
the Duke of Sutherland and his predecessors, removed
the people from the land created by God, suitable for
cultivation, and for the use of man, and put it under
brute animals; and threw the people upon bye-corners,
precipices, and barren moors, there exacting exorbitant
rack-rents, until the people were made penniless, so that
they could neither leave the place nor better their condition
in it. The potato-blight blasted their last hopes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
of retaining life upon the unproductive patches&mdash;hence
they became clamourous for food. Their distress was
made known through the public press; public meetings
were held, and it was managed by some known knaves
to saddle the God of providence with the whole misery&mdash;a
job in which many of God’s professing and well-paid
servants took a very active part. The generous public
responded; immense sums of money were placed in the
hands of Government agents and other individuals, to
save the people from death by famine on British soil.</p>

<p>“Colonel Gordon and his worthy allies were silent contributors,
though terrified. The gallant gentleman solicited
Government, through the Home Secretary, to purchase
the Island of Barra for a penal colony, but it would not
suit. Yet our humane Government sympathised with the
Colonel and his coadjutors, and consulted the honourable
and brave MacNeil, the chief pauper gauger of Scotland,
upon the most effective and speediest scheme to
relieve the gallant Colonel and colleagues from this clamour
and eye-sore, as well as to save their pockets from able-bodied
paupers. The result was, that a liberal grant
from the public money, which had been granted a twelve-month
before for the purpose of improving and cultivating
the Highlands, was made to Highland proprietors
to assist them to drain the nation of its best blood, and
to banish the Highlanders across the Atlantic, there to
die by famine among strangers in the frozen regions of
Canada, far from British sympathy, and far from the
resting-place of their brave ancestors, though the idea of
mingling with kindred dust, to the Highlanders, is a consolation
at death, more than any other race of people I
have known or read of under heaven.</p>

<p>“Oh! Christian people, Christian people, Christian
fathers and mothers, who are living at ease, and
never experienced such treatment and concomitant
sufferings; you Christian rulers, Christian electors,
and representatives, permit not Christianity to
blush and hide her face with shame before
heathenism and idolatry any longer. I speak
with reverence when I say, permit not Mahomet Ali to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
deride our Saviour with the conduct of His followers&mdash;allow
not demons to exclaim in the face of heaven,
‘What can you expect of us, when Christians, thy chosen
people, are guilty of such deeds of inhumanity to their own
species?’</p>

<p>“Come, then, for the sake of neglected humanity
and prostrated Christianity, and look at this helpless,
unfortunate people; place yourselves for a
moment in their hopeless condition at their embarkation,
decoyed, in the name of the British Government,
by false promises of assistance, to procure homes
and comforts in Canada, which were denied to them at
home&mdash;decoyed, I say, to an unwilling and partial consent&mdash;and
those who resisted or recoiled from this conditional
consent, and who fled to the caves and mountains
to hide themselves from the brigands, look at them,
chased and caught by policemen, constables, and other
underlings of Colonel Gordon, handcuffed, it is said, and
huddled together with the rest on an emigrant vessel.
Hear the sobbing, sighing, and throbbings of their
guileless, warm Highland hearts, taking their last look,
and bidding a final adieu to their romantic mountains
and valleys, the fertile straths, dales, and glens, which
their forefathers from time immemorial inhabited, and
where they are now lying in undisturbed and everlasting
repose, in spots endeared and sacred to the memory of
their unfortunate offspring, who must now bid a mournful
farewell to their early associations, which were as
dear and as sacred to them as their very existence, and
which had hitherto made them patient in suffering. But
follow them on their six weeks’ dreary passage, rolling
upon the mountainous billows of the Atlantic, ill-fed,
ill-clad, among sickness, disease, and excrements. Then
come ashore with them where death is in store for them&mdash;hear
the captain giving orders to discharge the cargo of
live stock&mdash;see the confusion, hear the noise, the bitter
weeping and bustle; hear mothers and children asking
fathers and husbands, where are we going? hear the
reply, ‘<span lang="gd" xml:lang="gd">chan eil fios againn</span>’&mdash;we know not; see them in
groups in search of the Government Agent, who, they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
were told, was to give them money; look at their despairing
countenances when they come to learn that no
agent in Canada is authorised to give them a penny;
hear them praying the captain to bring them back that
they might die among their native hills, that their ashes
might mingle with those of their forefathers; hear this
request refused, and the poor helpless wanderers bidding
adieu to the captain and crew, who showed them all the
kindness they could, and to the vessel to which they
formed something like an attachment during the voyage;
look at them scantily clothed, destitute of food, without
implements of husbandry, consigned to their fate, carrying
their children on their backs, begging as they crawl
along in a strange land, unqualified to beg or buy their
food for want of English, until the slow moving and
mournful company reach Toronto and Hamilton, in
Upper Canada, where, according to all accounts, they
spread themselves over their respective burying-places,
where famine and frost-bitten deaths were awaiting them.</p>

<p>“This is a painful picture, the English language
fails to supply me with words to describe it. I wish
the spectrum would depart from me to those who
could describe it and tell the result. But how can
Colonel Gordon, the Duke of Sutherland, James Loch,
Lord Macdonald, and others of the unhallowed league and
abettors, after looking at this sight, remain in Christian
communion, ruling elders in Christian Churches, and
partake of the emblems of Christ’s body broken and shed
blood? But the great question is, Can we as a nation
be guiltless and allow so many of our fellow creatures to
be treated in such a manner, and not exert ourselves
to put a stop to it and punish the perpetrators? Is
ambition, which attempted to dethrone God, become
omnipotent, or so powerful, when incarnated in the shape
of Highland dukes, lords, esquires, colonels, and
knights, that we must needs submit to its revolting
deeds? Are parchment rights of property so sacred that
thousands of human beings must be sacrificed year after
year, till there is no end of such, to preserve them inviolate?
Are sheep walks, deer forests, hunting parks,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
and game preserves, so beneficial to the nation that the
Highlands must be converted into a hunting desert, and
the aborigines banished and murdered? I know that
thousands will answer in the negative; yet they will fold
their arms in criminal apathy until the extirpation and
destruction of my race shall be completed. Fearful is
the catalogue of those who have already become the
victims of the cursed clearing system in the Highlands,
by famine, fire, drowning, banishment, vice, and crime.”</p>

<p>He then publishes the following communication from
an eye-witness, on the enormities perpetrated in South
Uist and in the Island of Barra in the summer of <span class="lock">1851:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>“The unfeeling and deceitful conduct of those acting for
Colonel Gordon cannot be too strongly censured. The
duplicity and art which was used by them in order to
entrap the unwary natives, is worthy of the craft and
cunning of an old slave-trader. Many of the poor people
were told in my hearing that Sir John M’Neil would be in
Canada before them, where he would have every necessary
prepared for them. Some of the officials signed a document
binding themselves to emigrate, in order to induce
the poor people to give their names; but in spite of all
these stratagems, many of the people saw through them
and refused out and out to go. When the transports
anchored in Loch Boisdale these tyrants threw off their
masks, and the work of devastation and cruelty commenced.
The poor people were commanded to attend a
public meeting at Loch Boisdale, where the transports
lay, and, according to the intimation, any one absenting
himself from the meeting was to be fined in the sum of
two pounds sterling. At this meeting some of the
natives were seized and, in spite of their entreaties, sent
on board the transports. One stout Highlander, named
Angus Johnston, resisted with such pith that they had to
handcuff him before he could be mastered; but in consequence
of the priest’s interference his manacles were
removed, and he was marched between four officers on
board the emigrant vessel. One morning, during the
transporting season, we were suddenly awakened by the
screams of a young female who had been re-captured in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
an adjoining house, she having escaped after her first
capture. We all rushed to the door, and saw the broken-hearted
creature, with dishevelled hair and swollen face,
dragged away by two constables and a ground officer.
Were you to see the racing and chasing of policemen,
constables, and ground officers, pursuing the outlawed
natives, you would think, only for their colour, that you
had been, by some miracle, transported to the banks of
the Gambia, on the slave coast of Africa.</p>

<p>“The conduct of the Rev. H. Beatson on that occasion is
deserving of the censure of every feeling heart. This
‘wolf in sheeps’ clothing’ made himself very officious,
as he always does, when he has an opportunity of oppressing
the poor Barra men, and of gaining the favour of
Colonel Gordon. In fact, he is the most vigilant and assiduous
officer Colonel Gordon has. He may be seen in Castle
Bay, the principal anchorage in Barra, whenever a sail is
hoisted, directing his men, like a gamekeeper with his
hounds, in case any of the doomed Barra men should
escape. He offered one day to board an Arran boat, that
had a poor man concealed, but the master, John Crawford,
lifted a hand-spike and threatened to split the skull of
the first man who would attempt to board his boat, and
thus the poor Barra man escaped their clutches.</p>

<p>“I may state in conclusion that, two girls, daughters of
John Macdougall, brother of Barr Macdougall, whose
name is mentioned in Sir John M’Neil’s report, have fled
to the mountains to elude the grasp of the expatriators,
where they still are, if in life. Their father, a frail, old
man, along with the rest of the family, has been sent to
Canada. The respective ages of these girls are 12 and
14 years. Others have fled in the same way, but I
cannot give their names just now.”<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a></p>

<p>We shall now take the reader after these people to
Canada, and witness their deplorable and helpless condition
and privations in a strange land. The following
is extracted from a Quebec <span class="lock">newspaper:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>“We noticed in our last the deplorable condition of the
600 paupers who were sent to this country from the Kil<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>rush
Unions. We have to-day a still more dismal picture
to draw. Many of our readers may not be aware
that there lives such a personage as Colonel Gordon,
proprietor of large estates in South Uist and Barra, in
the Highlands of Scotland. We are sorry to be obliged
to introduce him to their notice under circumstances
which will not give them a very favourable opinion of his
character and heart.</p>

<p>“It appears that his tenants on the above-mentioned
estates were on the verge of starvation, and had probably
become an eye-sore to the gallant Colonel! He decided
on shipping them to America. What they were to do
there was a question he never put to his conscience.
Once landed in Canada, he had no further concern about
them. Up to last week, some 1100 souls from his estates
had landed at Quebec, and begged their way to Upper
Canada; when in the summer season, having only a daily
morsel of food to procure, they probably escaped the
extreme misery which seems to be the lot of those who
followed them.</p>

<p>“On their arrival here, they voluntarily made and signed
the following statement:&mdash;‘We, the undersigned passengers
per <i>Admiral</i>, from Stornoway, in the Highlands
of Scotland, do solemnly depose to the following facts:&mdash;That
Colonel Gordon is proprietor of estates in South
Uist and Barra; that among many hundreds of tenants
and cottars whom he has sent this season from his estates
to Canada, he gave directions to his factor, Mr. Fleming of
Cluny Castle, Aberdeenshire, to ship on board of the
above-named vessel a number of nearly 450 of said
tenants and cottars, from the estate in Barra; that,
accordingly, a great majority of these people, among
whom were the undersigned, proceeded voluntarily to
embark on board the <i>Admiral</i>, at Loch Boisdale, on or
about the 11th August, 1851; but that several of the
people who were intended to be shipped for this port,
Quebec, refused to proceed on board, and, in fact,
absconded from their homes to avoid the embarkation.
Whereupon Mr. Fleming gave orders to a policeman,
who was accompanied by the ground officer of the estate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
in Barra, and some constables, to pursue the people,
who had run away, among the mountains; which they
did, and succeeded in capturing about twenty from the
mountains and islands in the neighbourhood; but only
came with the officers on an attempt being made to
handcuff them; and that some who ran away were not
brought back, in consequence of which four families at
least have been divided, some having come in the ships
to Quebec, while the other members of the same families
are left in the Highlands.</p>

<p>“‘The undersigned further declare that those who
voluntarily embarked did so under promises to the
effect that Colonel Gordon would defray their passage to
Quebec; that the Government Emigration Agent there
would send the whole party free to Upper Canada, where,
on arrival, the Government agents would give them work,
and furthermore, grant them land on certain conditions.</p>

<p>“‘The undersigned finally declare, that they are now
landed in Quebec so destitute, that if immediate relief be
not afforded them, and continued until they are settled in
employment, the whole will be liable to perish with want.’</p>

<p class="sig">
(Signed) “<span class="smcap">Hector Lamont</span>,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 5em;">and 70 others.</span><br />
</p>

<p>“This is a beautiful picture! Had the scene been laid
in Russia or Turkey, the barbarity of the proceeding
would have shocked the nerves of the reader; but when
it happens in Britain, emphatically the land of liberty,
where every man’s house, even the hut of the poorest, is
said to be his castle, the expulsion of these unfortunate
creatures from their homes&mdash;the man-hunt with policemen
and bailiffs&mdash;the violent separation of families&mdash;the
parent torn from the child, the mother from her daughter,
the infamous trickery practised on those who did embark&mdash;the
abandonment of the aged, the infirm, women,
and tender children, in a foreign land&mdash;forms a tableau
which cannot be dwelt on for an instant without horror.
Words cannot depict the atrocity of the deed. For
cruelty less savage, the slave-dealers of the South have
been held up to the execration of the world.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span></p>

<p>“And if, as men, the sufferings of these our fellow-creatures
find sympathy in our hearts, as Canadians
their wrongs concern us more dearly. The fifteen hundred
souls whom Colonel Gordon has sent to Quebec this
season have all been supported for the past week, at least,
and conveyed to Upper Canada at the expense of the
colony; and on their arrival in Toronto and Hamilton
the greater number have been dependent on the charity
of the benevolent for a morsel of bread. Four hundred
are in the river at present, and will arrive in a day or two,
making a total of nearly 2000 of Colonel Gordon’s tenants
and cottars whom the province will have to support.
The winter is at hand, work is becoming scarce in Upper
Canada. Where are these people to find food?”<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a></p>

<p>We take the following from an Upper Canadian paper
describing the position of the same people after finding
their way to <span class="lock">Ontario:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>“We have been pained beyond measure for some
time past to witness in our streets so many unfortunate
Highland emigrants, apparently destitute
of any means of subsistence, and many of them
sick from want and other attendant causes. It was pitiful
the other day to view a funeral of one of these
wretched people. It was, indeed, a sad procession.
The coffin was constructed of the rudest material; a few
rough boards nailed together was all that could be
afforded to convey to its last resting-place the body of the
homeless emigrant. Children followed in the mournful
train; perchance they followed a brother’s bier, one with
whom they had sported and played for many a healthful
day among their native glens. Theirs were looks of
indescribable sorrow. They were in rags; their mourning
weeds were the shapeless fragments of what had once
been clothes. There was a mother, too, among the
mourners, one who had tended the departed with anxious
care in infancy, and had doubtless looked forward to a
happier future in this land of plenty. The anguish of
her countenance told too plainly these hopes were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
blasted, and she was about to bury them in the grave of
her child.</p>

<p>“There will be many to sound the fulsome noise of
flattery in the ear of the generous landlord, who had spent
so much to assist the emigration of his poor tenants.
They will give him the misnomer of a <em>benefactor</em>, and
for what? Because he has rid his estates of the encumbrance
of a pauper population.</p>

<p>“Emigrants of the poorer class who arrive here from the
Western Highlands of Scotland are often so situated that
their emigration is more cruel than banishment. Their
last shilling is spent probably before they reach the upper
province&mdash;they are reduced to the necessity of begging.
But, again, the case of those emigrants of whom we speak
is rendered more deplorable from their ignorance of the
English tongue. Of the hundreds of Highlanders in and
around Dundas at present, perhaps not half-a-dozen
understand anything but Gaelic.</p>

<p>“In looking at these matters, we are impressed with the
conviction that, so far from emigration being a panacea
for Highland destitution, it is fraught with disasters of no
ordinary magnitude to the emigrant whose previous
habits, under the most favourable circumstances, render
him unable to take advantage of the industry of Canada,
even when brought hither free of expense. We may assist
these poor creatures for a time, but charity will scarcely
bide the hungry cravings of so many for a very long
period. Winter is approaching, and then&mdash;but we leave
this painful subject for the present.<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a>”</p>

<h3>THE ISLAND OF RUM.</h3>

<p>This island, at one time, had a large population, all of
whom were weeded out in the usual way. The Rev.
Donald Maclean, Minister of the Parish of Small Isles,
informs us in <cite>The New Statistical Account</cite>, that “in 1826
all the inhabitants of the Island of Rum, amounting at
least to 400 souls, found it necessary to leave their native<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
land, and to seek for new abodes in the distant wilds of
our colonies in America. Of all the old residenters, only
one family remained upon the Island. The old and the
young, the feeble and the strong, were all united in this
general emigration&mdash;the former to find tombs in a foreign
land&mdash;the latter to encounter toils, privations, and dangers,
to become familiar with customs, and to acquire
that to which they had been entire strangers. A similar
emigration took place in 1828, from the Island of Muck,
so that the parish has now become much depopulated.”</p>

<p>In 1831 the population of the whole parish was 1015,
while before that date it was much larger. In 1851 it
was 916. In 1881 it was reduced to 550. The total
population of Rum in 1881 was 89 souls.</p>

<p>Hugh Miller, who visited the Island, describes it and
the evictions <span class="lock">thus:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>“The evening was clear, calm, golden-tinted;
even wild heaths and rude rocks had assumed
a flush of transient beauty; and the emerald-green
patches on the hill-sides, barred by the plough
lengthwise, diagonally, and transverse, had borrowed
an aspect of soft and velvety richness, from the
mellowed light and the broadening shadows. All was
solitary. We could see among the deserted fields the
grass-grown foundations of cottages razed to the ground;
but the valley, more desolate than that which we had left,
had not even its single inhabited dwelling; it seemed as
if man had done with it for ever. The island, eighteen
years before, had been divested of its inhabitants,
amounting at the time to rather more than four hundred
souls, to make way for one sheep farmer and eight
thousand sheep. All the aborigines of Rum crossed the
Atlantic; and, at the close of 1828, the entire population
consisted of but the sheep farmer, and a few shepherds,
his servants: the Island of Rum reckoned up scarce a
single family at this period for every five square miles of
area which it contained. But depopulation on so extreme
a scale was found inconvenient; the place had been
rendered too thoroughly a desert for the comfort of the
occupant; and on the occasion of a clearing which took<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
place shortly after in Skye, he accommodated some ten
or twelve of the ejected families with sites for cottages,
and pasturage for a few cows, on the bit of morass beside
Loch Scresort, on which I had seen their humble dwellings.
But the whole of the once-peopled interior remains
a wilderness, without inhabitants,&mdash;all the more lonely
in its aspect from the circumstance that the solitary
valleys, with their plough-furrowed patches, and their
ruined heaps of stone, open upon shores every whit as
solitary as themselves, and that the wide untrodden
sea stretches drearily around.</p>

<p>“The armies of the insect world were sporting
in the light this evening by the million; a
brown stream that runs through the valley yielded
an incessant poppling sound, from the myriads
of fish that were ceaselessly leaping in the pools, beguiled
by the quick glancing wings of green and gold that
fluttered over them; along a distant hillside there ran
what seemed the ruins of a grey-stone fence, erected, says
tradition, in a remote age to facilitate the hunting of the
deer; there were fields on which the heath and moss of
the surrounding moorlands were fast encroaching, that
had borne many a successive harvest; and prostrate
cottages, that had been the scenes of christenings, and
bridals, and blythe new-year’s days;&mdash;all seemed to
bespeak the place of fitting habitation for man, in which
not only the necessaries, but also a few of the luxuries of
life, might be procured; but in the entire prospect not a
man nor a man’s dwelling could the eye command. The
landscape was one without figures.</p>

<p>“I do not much like extermination carried
out so thoroughly and on system;&mdash;it seems bad
policy; and I have not succeeded in thinking any
the better of it though assured by the economists
that there are more than enough people in
Scotland still. There are, I believe, more than enough in
our workhouses&mdash;more than enough on our pauper rolls&mdash;more
than enough muddled up, disreputable, useless, and
unhappy, in their miasmatic valleys and typhoid courts of
our large towns; but I have yet to learn how arguments<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
for local depopulation are to be drawn from facts such as
these. A brave and hardy people, favourably placed for
the development of all that is excellent in human nature,
form the glory and strength of a country;&mdash;a people sunk
into an abyss of degradation and misery, and in which it
is the whole tendency of external circumstances to sink
them yet deeper, constitute its weakness and its shame;
and I cannot quite see on what principle the ominous
increase which is taking place among us in the worse class,
is to form our solace or apology for the wholesale expatriation
of the better.</p>

<p>“It did not seem as if the depopulation of Rum had
tended much to anyone’s advantage. The single
sheep farmer who had occupied the holdings of so
many had been unfortunate in his speculations, and
had left the island; the proprietor, his landlord, seemed
to have been as little fortunate as the tenant, for the
island itself was in the market, and a report went current
at the time that it was on the eve of being purchased by
some wealthy Englishman, who purposed converting it
into a deer forest.</p>

<p>“How strange a cycle! Uninhabited originally, save
by wild animals, it became at an early period a
home of men, who, as the gray wall on the hillside
testified, derived in part at least, their sustenance from
the chase. They broke in from the waste the furrowed
patches on the slopes of the valleys,&mdash;they reared herds of
cattle and flocks of sheep,&mdash;their number increased to
nearly five hundred souls,&mdash;they enjoyed the average
happiness of human creatures in the present imperfect
state of being,&mdash;they contributed their portion of hardy
and vigorous manhood to the armies of the country, and
a few of their more adventurous spirits, impatient of the
narrow bounds which confined them, and a course of life
little varied by incident, emigrated to America. Then
came the change of system so general in the Highlands;
and the island lost all its original inhabitants, on a wool
and mutton speculation,&mdash;inhabitants, the descendants
of men who had chased the deer on its hills five hundred
years before, and who, though they recognized some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
wild island lord as their superior, and did him service,
had regarded the place as indisputably their own. And
now yet another change was on the eve of ensuing, and
the island was to return to its original state, as a home of
wild animals, where a few hunters from the mainland
might enjoy the chase for a month or two every twelve-month,
but which could form no permanent place of
human abode. Once more a strange, and surely most
melancholy cycle!”<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a></p>

<p>In another place the same writer asks,</p>

<p>“Where was the one tenant of the island, for whose
sake so many others had been removed?” and he
answers, “We found his house occupied by a humble
shepherd, who had in charge the wreck of his property,&mdash;property
no longer his, but held for the benefit of his
creditors. The great sheep farmer had gone down
under circumstances of very general bearing, and on
whose after development, when in their latent state,
improving landlords had failed to calculate.”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Harris</span> and the other Western Islands suffered in a
similar manner. Mull, Tiree, and others in Argyllshire
are noticed in dealing with that county.</p>

<p>In many parts of Argyllshire the people have been
weeded out none the less effectively, that the process
generally was of a milder nature than that adopted in
some of the places already described. By some means or
other, however, the ancient tenantry have largely disappeared
to make room for the sheep farmer and the
sportsman. Mr. Somerville, Lochgilphead, writing on
this subject, says, “The watchword of all is exterminate,
exterminate the native race. Through this monomania of
landlords the cottier population is all but extinct; and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
the substantial yeoman is undergoing the same process of
dissolution.” He then <span class="lock">proceeds:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>“About nine miles of country on the west side of
Loch Awe, in Argyllshire, that formerly maintained 45
families, are now rented by one person as a sheep
farm; and in the island of Luing, same county,
which formerly contained about 50 substantial
farmers, besides cottiers, this number is now reduced
to about six. The work of eviction commenced
by giving, in many cases, to the ejected population,
facilities and pecuniary aid for emigration; but now the
people are turned adrift, penniless and shelterless, to
seek a precarious subsistence on the sea-board, in the
nearest hamlet or village, and in the cities, many of whom
sink down helpless paupers on our poor-roll; and others,
festering in our villages, form a formidable Arab population,
who drink our money contributed as parochial
relief. This wholesale depopulation is perpetrated, too,
in a spirit of invidiousness, harshness, cruelty, and injustice,
and must eventuate in permanent injury to the
moral, political, and social interests of the kingdom....
The immediate effects of this new system are the dissociation
of the people from the land, who are virtually
denied the right to labour on God’s creation. In L&mdash;&mdash;,
for instance, garden ground and small allotments of land
are in great demand by families, and especially by the
aged, whose labouring days are done, for the purpose of
keeping cows, and by which they might be able to earn
an honest, independent maintenence for their families,
and whereby their children might be brought up to labour
instead of growing up vagabonds and thieves. But
such, even in our centres of population, cannot be got;
the whole is let in large farms and turned into grazing.
The few patches of bare pasture, formed by the delta of
rivers, the detritus of rocks, and tidal deposits, are let for
grazing at the exorbitant rent of £3 10s. each for a small
Highland cow; and the small space to be had for garden
ground is equally extravagant. The consequence of these
exorbitant rents and the want of agricultural facilities is a
depressed, degraded, and pauperised population.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span></p>

<p>These remarks are only too true, and applicable
not only in Argyllshire, but throughout the Highlands
generally.</p>

<p>A deputation from the Glasgow Highland Relief Board,
consisting of Dr. Robert Macgregor, and Mr. Charles R.
Baird, their Secretary, visited Mull, Ulva, Iona, Tiree,
Coll, and part of Morvern, in 1849, and they immediately
afterwards issued a printed report on the state of these
places, from which a few extracts will prove instructive.
They inform us that the population of</p>

<h3>THE ISLAND OF MULL.</h3>

<p>according to the Government Census of 1821, was 10,612;
in 1841, 10,064. In 1871, we find it reduced to 6441,
and by the Census of 1881, now before us, it is stated at
5624, or a fraction more than half the number that inhabited
the Island in 1821.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tobermory</span>, we are told, “has been for some time the
resort of the greater part of the small crofters and cottars,
<em>ejected</em> from their holdings and houses on the surrounding
estates, and thus there has been a great accumulation of
distress.” Then we are told that “severe as the
destitution has been in the rural districts, we think it has
been still more so in Tobermory and other villages”&mdash;a
telling comment on, and reply to, those who would now
have us believe that the evictors of those days and of our
own were acting the character of wise benefactors when
they ejected the people from the inland and rural districts
of the various counties to wretched villages, and rocky
hamlets on the sea-shore.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ulva.</span>&mdash;The population of the Island of Ulva in
1849 was 360 souls. The reporters state that a “large
portion” of it “has lately been converted into a sheep
farm, and consequently a number of small crofters and
cottars have been warned away” by Mr. Clark. “Some
of these will find great difficulty in settling themselves
anywhere, and all of them have little prospect of employment....
Whatever may be the ultimate effect
to the landowners of the conversion of a number of small<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
crofts into large farms, we need scarcely say that this
process is causing much poverty and misery among the
crofters.” How Mr. Clark carried out his intention of
evicting the tenantry of Ulva may be seen from the fact
that the population of 360 souls, in 1849, was reduced to
51 in 1881.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kilfinichen.</span>&mdash;In this district we are told that “The
crofters and cottars having been warned off, 26
individuals emigrated to America, at their own expense
and one at that of the Parochial Board; a good many
removed to Kinloch, where they are now in great poverty,
and those who remained were not allowed to cultivate
any ground for crop or even garden stuffs. The stock
and other effects of a number of crofters on Kinloch
last year (1848), whose rents averaged from £5 to
£15 per annum, having been sequestrated and sold, these
parties are now reduced to a state of pauperism, having
no employment or means of subsistence whatever.” As
to the cottars, it is said that “the great mass of them are
now in a very deplorable state.” On the estate of</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gribun</span>, Colonel Macdonald of Inchkenneth, the proprietor,
gave the people plenty of work, by which they
were quite independent of relief from any quarter, and
the character which he gives to the deputation of the
people generally is most refreshing, when we compare it
with the baseless charges usually made against them by
the majority of his class. The reporters state that
“Colonel Macdonald spoke in high terms of the honesty
of the people and of their great patience and forbearance
under their severe privations.” It is gratifying to be able
to record this simple act of justice, not only as the people’s
due, but specially to the credit of Colonel Macdonald’s
memory and goodness of heart.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bunessan.</span>&mdash;Respecting this district, belonging to the
Duke of Argyll, our authority says:&mdash;“It will be recollected
that the [Relief] Committee, some time ago,
advanced £128 to assist in procuring provisions for a
number of emigrants from the Duke of Argyll’s estate,
in the Ross of Mull and Iona, in all 243 persons&mdash;125
adults and 118 children. When there, we made inquiry<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
into the matter, and were informed [by those, as it proved,
quite ignorant of the facts] that the emigration had been
productive of much good, as the parties who emigrated
could not find the means of subsistence in this country,
and had every <em>prospect</em> of doing so in Canada, where all of
them had relations; and also because the land occupied
by some of these emigrants had been given to increase
the crofts of others. Since our return home, however,
we have received the very melancholy and distressing
intelligence, that many of these emigrants had been seized
with cholera on their arrival in Canada; that not a few
of them had fallen victims to it; and that the survivors
had suffered great privations.” Compare the “prospect,”
of much good, predicted for these poor creatures, with
the sad reality of having been forced away to die a
terrible death immediately on their arrival on a foreign
shore!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Iona</span>, at this time, contained a population of 500,
reduced in 1881 to 243. It also is the property of the
Duke of Argyll, as well as</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Island of Tiree</span>, the population of which is
given in the report as follows:&mdash;In 1755, it was 1509,
increasing in 1777, to 1681; in 1801, to 2416; in 1821, to
4181; and in 1841 to 4687. In 1849, “after considerable
emigrations,” it was 3903; while in 1881, it was reduced to
2733. The deputation recommended emigration from
Tiree as imperatively necessary, but they “call especial
attention to the necessity of emigration being conducted
on proper principles, or, ‘on a system calculated to promote
the permanent benefit of those who emigrate, and of
those who remain,’ because we have reason to fear that
not a few parties in these districts are anxious to get rid of
the small crofters and cottars at all hazard, and without
making sufficient provision for their future comfort and
settlement elsewhere; and because we have seen the very
distressing account of the privations and sufferings of the
poor people who emigrated from Tiree and the Ross of
Mull to Canada this year (1849), and would spare no pains
to prevent a recurrence of such deplorable circumstances.
As we were informed that the Duke of Argyll had ex<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>pended
nearly £1200 on account of the emigrants (in all
247 souls) from Tiree; as the Committee advanced
£131 15s. to purchase provisions for them; and as funds
were remitted to Montreal to carry them up the country,
we sincerely trust that the account we have seen of their
sufferings in Canada is somewhat over-charged, and that
it is not at all events to be ascribed to want of due provision
being made for them, ere they left this country, to
carry them to their destination. Be this as it may,
however, we trust that no emigration will in future be
promoted by proprietors or others, which will not secure,
as far as human effort can, <em>the benefit of those who emigrate</em>,
as well as of those who are left at home.... Being
aware of the poverty of the great majority of the inhabitants
of this island, and of the many difficulties with
which they have to contend, we were agreeably surprised
to find their dwellings remarkably neat and clean&mdash;very
superior indeed, both externally and internally, to those
of the other islands; nay, more, such as would bear
comparison with cottages in any part of the kingdom.
The inhabitants, too, we believe, are active and enterprising,
and, if once put in a fair way of doing so, would
soon raise themselves to comfort and independence.”
Very good, indeed, Tiree!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Island of Coll</span>, which is separated from Tiree by
a channel only two miles in width, had a population, in
1755, of 1193; in 1771, of 1200; in 1801, of 1162; in
1821, of 1264. In 1841 it reached 1409. At the time
of the visit of the deputation, from whose report we quote,
the population of the Island was down to 1235; while in
1881 it had fallen to 643. The deputation report that
during the destitution the work done by the Coll people
“approximates, if it does exceed, the supplies given;”
they are “hard working and industrious.... We saw
considerable tracts of ground which we were assured
might be reclaimed and cultivated with profit, and are
satisfied that fishing is a resource capable of great improvement,
and at which, therefore, many of the people
might be employed to advantage; we are disposed to
think that, by a little attention and prudent outlay of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
capital, the condition of the people here might ere long
be greatly improved. The grand difficulty in the way,
however, is the want of capital. Mr. Maclean, the principal
proprietor, always acted most liberally when he had
it in his power to do so, but, unfortunately, he has no
longer the ability, and the other two proprietors are also
under trust.” Notwithstanding these possibilities the
population is undergoing a constant process of
diminution.</p>

<p>We shall now return to the mainland portion of the
County, and take a glance at the parish of</p>

<h3>ARDNAMURCHAN.<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a></h3>

<p>“<span lang="gd" xml:lang="gd">Uaine gu’m mullach</span>” (green to their tops!). So Dr.
Norman Macleod described the bens of Ardnamurchan
in his inimitable sketch, the “Emigrant Ship,” and so
they appear even to this day. Their beautiful slopes show
scarcely a vestige of heather, but an abundance of rich,
sweet grass of a quality eminently suitable for pasturage.</p>

<p>As the steamboat passenger sails northward through
the Sound of Mull, he sees straight ahead, and stretching
at right angles across his course, a long range of low
hills culminating in a finely-shaped mass which seems to
rise abruptly from the edge of the sea. The hills are those
of Ardnamurchan, and the dominating pile is Ben Hiant,
1729 feet in height, and “green to its top.” Around the
base of the mountain and for miles in every direction the
land is fair, fertile, and well adapted either for arable
or grazing purposes. It comprises the farm of Mingary,
and, to-day, is wholly under deer.</p>

<p>Down to the second decade of last century it supported
about twenty-six families, which were distributed over
the component townships of Coire-mhuilinn, Skinid,
Buarblaig, and Tornamona. At one sweep, the whole
place was cleared, and the grounds added to the adjacent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
sheep farm of Mingary. The evictions were carried out
in 1828, the process being attended with many acts of
heartless cruelty on the part of the laird’s representatives.
In one case a half-witted woman who flatly refused to
flit, was locked up in her cottage, the door being barricaded
on the outside by mason-work. She was visited
every morning to see if she had arrived at a tractable
frame of mind, but for days she held out. It was not
until her slender store of food was exhausted that she
ceased to argue with the inevitable and decided to capitulate.
It is to cases of this character that Dr. John
MacLachlan, the Sweet Singer of Rahoy, referred in
the lines&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container" lang="gd" xml:lang="gd"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
      <div class="verse">“An dall, an seann duine san oinid</div>
      <div class="verse">Toirt am mallachd air do bhuaireas.”</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>(The blind, the aged, and the imbecile calling curses on
thy greed.) The proprietor at whose instance these
“removals” were carried out was Sir James Milles
Riddell, Bart. Of the dislodged families a few were given
small patches of waste land, some were given holdings in
various townships on the estate&mdash;the crofts of which were
sub-divided for their accommodation&mdash;and some were
forced to seek sanctuary beyond the Atlantic.</p>

<p>Additional clearances were effected on the Ardnamurchan
estate in 1853, when Swordle-chaol, Swordle-mhor,
and Swordle-chorrach, with an aggregate area of
about 3000 acres, were divested of their crofting population,
and thrown into a single sheep farm. Swordle-chaol
was occupied by four tenants, Swordle-mhor by
six, and Swordle-chorrach by six. Five years previous
to the evictions, all the crofters came under a written
obligation to the proprietor to build new dwelling-houses.
The walls were to be of stone and lime, 40 ft.
long, 17&frac12; ft. wide, and 7&frac12; ft. high. The houses, two-gabled,
were to have each two rooms and a kitchen, with
wooden ceiling and floors, the kitchen alone to be floored
with flags. By the end of 1851 all the tenants had
faithfully implemented their promise, and the work of
building was quite completed. Tradesmen had been
employed in every case, and the cost averaged from £45<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
to £50. When the people were ejected, two years later,
they received no compensation whatever for their
labours and outlays. They were not even permitted to
remove a door, a window, or a fixed cupboard. Some of
the houses are still intact in this year of grace, 1914, one
being occupied by a shepherd on Swordle farm, and another
used as a byre. They compare favourably as regards
size, design, and workmanship with the best and
most modern crofter houses in the Ardnamurchan district.
The Swordle tenants were among the best-to-do
on the estate, and not one of them owed the proprietor
a shilling in the way of arrears of rent. When cast adrift,
the majority of them were assigned “holdings” of one
acre or so in the rough lands of Sanna and Portuairk,
where they had to start to reclaim peatbogs and to build
for themselves houses and steadings. Sir James Milles
Riddell was the proprietor responsible for clearing the
Swordles as well as the Ben Hiant townships.<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a></p>

<p>Other places which he divested of people and placed
under sheep were Laga, held by eight tenants, and Tarbert,
which was in the hands of four.</p>

<p>About sixteen years ago Ben Hiant, or Mingary, as
well as the Swordles, Laga, Tarbert, and other farms,
was swept clean of sheep and converted into a deer forest,
the preserve having a total area of 22,000 acres. The
woolly ruminants met with a retribution, direful and
complete, and the native people viewed the change with
mild amusement. Sheep had been the means of ruining
their forefathers, whereas deer had never done them or
their kinsfolk the smallest injury.</p>

<p>The highest hill on the estate of Ardnamurchan is
Ben Hiant, the altitude of which is 1729 feet. It may
be described as an isolated peak. It forms no part of
any definite mountain range, although, when viewed
from the sea, it seems to blend with Ben an Leathaid
and other local eminences. For the most part, the
elevation of the area embraced in the Ardnamurchan
deer forest varies from 600 feet or 700 feet to sea-level.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span></p>

<p>MORVEN.</p>

<p>The population of this extensive parish in 1755 was
1223; in 1795 it increased to 1764; in 1801 to 2000; in
1821, it was 1995; in 1831, it rose to 2137; and in 1841
it came down to 1781; in 1871, it was only 973; while
in the Census Returns for 1881 we find it stated at 714,
or less than one-third of what it was fifty years before.</p>

<p>The late Dr. Norman Macleod, after describing the
happy state of things which existed in this parish before
the clearances, <span class="lock">says:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>“But all this was changed when those tacksmen
were swept away to make room for the large
sheep farms, and when the remnants of the people
flocked from their empty glens to occupy houses in
wretched villages near the sea-shore, by way of becoming
fishers&mdash;often where no fish could be caught. The result
has been that ‘the Parish,’ for example, which once had a
population of 2200 souls, and received only £11 per
annum from public (Church) funds for the support of the
poor, expends now [1863] under the poor law upwards of
£600 annually, with a population diminished by one-half
[since diminished to one-third] and with poverty increased
in a greater ratio.... Below these gentlemen
tacksmen were those who paid a much lower rent, and
who lived very comfortably, and shared hospitality with
others, the gifts which God gave them. I remember a
group of men, tenants in a large glen, which now has not
a smoke in it, as the Highlanders say, throughout its
length of twenty miles. They had the custom of entertaining
in rotation every traveller who cast himself on
their hospitality. The host on the occasion was bound
to summon his neighbours to the homely feast. It was
my good fortune to be a guest when they received the
present minister of ‘the Parish,’ while <i>en route</i> to visit
some of his flock. We had a most sumptuous feast&mdash;oat-cakes,
crisp and fresh from the fire; cream, rich and
thick, and more beautiful than nectar,&mdash;whatever
that may be; blue Highland cheese, finer than Stilton;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
fat hens, slowly cooked on the fire in a pot of potatoes,
without their skins, and with fresh butter&mdash;‘stoved
hens,’ as the superb dish was called; and though last,
not least, tender kid, roasted as nicely as Charles Lamb’s
cracklin’ pig. All was served up with the utmost propriety,
on a table covered with a fine white cloth, and with
all the requisites for a comfortable dinner, including the
champagne of elastic, buoyant, and exciting mountain
air. The manners and conversations of those men would
have pleased the best-bred gentleman. Everything was
so simple, modest, unassuming, unaffected, yet so frank
and cordial. The conversation was such as might be
heard at the table of any intelligent man. Alas! there
is not a vestige remaining of their homes. I know not
whither they are gone, but they have left no representatives
behind. The land in the glen is divided between
sheep, shepherds, and the shadows of the clouds.”<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a></p>

<p>The Rev. Donald Macleod, editor of <cite>Good Words</cite>&mdash;describing
the death of the late Dr. John Macleod, the
“minister of the Parish” referred to by Dr. Norman
in the above quotation, and for fifty years minister of
Morven&mdash;says of the noble <span class="lock">patriarch:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>“His later years were spent in pathetic loneliness.
He had seen his parish almost emptied of its
people. Glen after glen had been turned into
sheep-walks, and the cottages in which generations
of gallant Highlanders had lived and died were
unroofed, their torn walls and gables left standing
like mourners beside the grave, and the little plots of
garden or of cultivated enclosure allowed to merge into
the moorland pasture. He had seen every property in
the parish change hands, and though, on the whole,
kindly and pleasant proprietors came in place of the old
families, yet they were strangers to the people, neither
understanding their language nor their ways. The consequence
was that they perhaps scarcely realised the
havoc produced by the changes they inaugurated. ‘At
one stroke of the pen,’ he said to me, with a look of sad<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>ness
and indignation, ‘two hundred of the people were
ordered off. There was not one of these whom I did not
know, and their fathers before them; and finer men and
women never left the Highlands.’ He thus found himself
the sole remaining link between the past and present&mdash;the
one man above the rank of a peasant who remembered
the old days and the traditions of the people. The
sense of change was intensely saddened as he went
through his parish and passed ruined houses here, there,
and everywhere. ‘There is not a smoke there now,’ he
used to say with pathos, of the glens which he had known
tenanted by a manly and loyal peasantry, among whom
lived song and story and the elevating influences of
brave traditions. All are gone, and the place that once
knew them, knows them no more! The hill-side, which
had once borne a happy people and echoed the voices of
joyous children is now a silent sheep walk. The supposed
necessities of Political Economy have effected the
exchange, but the day may come when the country may
feel the loss of the loyal and brave race which has been
driven away, and find a new meaning perhaps in the old
question, ‘Is not a man better than a sheep?’ They
who ‘would have shed their blood like water’ for Queen
and country, are in other lands, Highland still, but
expatriated for ever.</p>

<h3>GLENORCHY.</h3>

<p>Glenorchy, of which the Marquis of Breadalbane is
sole proprietor, was, like many other places, ruthlessly
cleared of its whole native population. The writer of the
New Statistical Account of the Parish, in 1843, the Rev.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
Duncan Maclean, “Fior Ghael” of the <cite>Teachdaire</cite>,
informs us that the census taken by Dr. Webster in 1755,
and by Dr. MacIntyre forty years later, in 1795, “differ
exceedingly little,” only to the number of sixty. The
Marquis of the day, it is well known, was a good friend
of his reverence; the feeling was naturally reciprocated,
and one of the apparent results is that the reverend
author abstained from giving, in his Account of the
Parish, the population statistics of the Glenorchy district.
It was, however, impossible to pass over that important
portion of his duty altogether, and, apparently
with reluctance, he makes the following sad admission:&mdash;“A
great and rapid decrease has, however, taken place
since [referring to the population in 1795]. This decrease
is mainly attributable to the introduction of sheep,
and the absorption of small into large tenements. The
aboriginal population of the parish of Glenorchy (not
of Inishail) has been nearly supplanted by adventurers
from the neighbouring district of Breadalbane, who now
occupy the far largest share of the parish. There are a
few, and only a few, shoots from the stems that supplied
the ancient population. Some clans, who were rather
numerous and powerful, have disappeared altogether;
others, viz., the Downies, Macnabs, Macnicols, and
Fletchers, have nearly ceased to exist. The Macgregors,
at one time lords of the soil, have totally disappeared;
not one of the name is to be found among the population.
The Macintyres, at once time extremely numerous, are
likewise greatly reduced.”</p>

<p>By this nobleman’s mania for evictions, the population
of Glenorchy was reduced from 1806 in 1831 to 831 in
1841, or by nearly a thousand souls in the short space
of ten years! It is, however, gratifying to find that it
has since, under wiser management, very largely increased.</p>

<p>In spite of all this we have been seriously told that there
has been no</p>



<p class="center">DEPOPULATION OF THE COUNTY</p>

<p>in the rural districts. In this connection some very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
extraordinary public utterances were recently made by
two gentlemen closely connected with the county of
Argyll, questioning or attempting to explain away statements,
made in the House of Commons by Mr. D. H.
Macfarlane, M.P., to the effect that the rural population
was, from various causes, fast disappearing from the
Highlands. These utterances were&mdash;one by a no less
distinguished person that the Duke of Argyll, who
published his remarkable propositions in the <cite>Times</cite>;
the other by Mr. John Ramsay, M.P., the Islay distiller,
who imposed his baseless statement on his brother members
in the House of Commons. These oracles should
have known better. They must clearly have taken no
trouble whatever to ascertain the facts for themselves, or,
having ascertained them, kept them back that the public
might be misled on a question with which, it is obvious to
all, the personal interests of both are largely mixed up.</p>

<p>Let us see how the assertions of these authorities agreed
with the actual facts. In 1831 the population of the
county of Argyll was 100,973; in 1841 it was 97,371; in
1851 it was reduced to 88,567; and in 1881 it was down
to 76,468. Of the latter number the Registrar-General
classifies 30,387 as urban, or the population of “towns
and villages,” leaving us only 46,081 as the total rural
population of the county of Argyll at the date of the last
Census, in 1881. In 1911 the total population for the
county had dropped to 70,902.</p>

<p>It will be necessary to keep in mind that in 1831 the
county could not be said to have had many “town and
village” inhabitants&mdash;not more than from 12,000 to
15,000 at most. These resided chiefly in Campbeltown,
Inveraray, and Oban; and if we deduct from the total
population for that year, numbering 100,973, even the
larger estimate, 15,000 of an urban or town population,
we have still left, in 1831, an actual rural population of
85,973, or within a fraction of double the whole rural
population of the county in 1881. In other words, the
rural population of Argyllshire was reduced in fifty years
from 85,973 to 46,081, or nearly by one-half.</p>

<p>The increase of the urban or town population is going<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
on at a fairly rapid rate; Campbeltown, Dunoon, Oban,
Ballachulish, Blairmore, and Strone, Innellan, Lochgilphead,
Tarbet, and Tighnabruaich, combined, having
added no less than some 5500 to the population of the
county in the ten years from 1871 to 1881. These populous
places will be found respectively in the parishes of
Campbeltown, Lismore, and Appin, Dunoon and Kilmun,
Glassary, Kilcalmonell and Kilbery, and in Kilfinan;
and this will at once account for the comparatively
good figure which these parishes make in the tabulated
statement in the Appendix. That table will show exactly
in which parishes and at what rate depopulation progressed
during the last fifty years. In many instances
the population was larger prior to 1831 than at that date,
but the years given will generally give the best idea of how
the matter stood throughout that whole period. The
state of the population given in 1831 was before the
famine which occurred in 1836; while that in 1841 comes
in between that of 1836 and 1846-47, during which period
large numbers were sent away, or left for the Colonies.
There was no famine between 1851 and 1881, a time
during which the population was reduced from 88,567
to 76,468, notwithstanding the great increase which took
place simultaneously in the “town and village” section
of the people in the county, as well as throughout the
country generally.</p>

</div>

<p>Once upon a time&mdash;and the time was 1828&mdash;Alexander,
tenth Duke of Hamilton, decided that he would make
large farms on his estate, and, of course, the will and wish<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
of a duke in his own domains must be respected, even
though&mdash;as in one instance&mdash;the land rented by twenty-seven
families was converted into one farm.</p>

<p>For various reasons, the islanders had for many years
been discontented, and there seemed no hope of a change
for the better. If a man worked his place in a progressive
way and made improvements on the farm, the benefit
accrued solely to the landed proprietor, who thanked the
good tenant by promptly raising his rent. If the farmer
objected to paying more rent, his only alternative was to
submit to be turned off his holding at the expiration of
his lease; then the landlord would collect the increased
rent from the new tenant.</p>

<p>So when the duke made overtures to a large number of
his tenants to the effect that if they would make room for
him by getting away from their ancestral moorings in
Arran, he would see that they were well provided for in
the new world, it is not to be wondered at that they
accepted his proposition. It is so nice when you are cast
out to be told where you can go, and be directed what to
do. The Duke promised to secure for each family a grant
of 100 acres of land in Canada, and the same amount of
land for each son in each family who at that time had
reached the age of 21.</p>

<p>Arrived at their destination at Johnston Ford, province
of Quebec, each family constructed a tent by stretching
blankets, quilts, etc., over poles suitably disposed and
tied together at the top with withes and ropes. Fortunately
the season was favourable and fires were needed
only for cooking. As just stated, the Duke of Hamilton
had promised that each family and each young man who
had attained his majority should receive a grant of 100
acres of land; but, when the colony was actually on the
scene, the Government officials refused to give a grant
except to the heads of the families.</p>

<p>The matter of grants has been so variously stated that
it is difficult to determine what the conditions were, but it
appears that the actual agreement of the Duke of Hamilton
was that grants should be given for two years only.
Those who came out in 1829 and 1830 secured certain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
grants after a delay. Those, however, who did not arrive
till 1831 were told by the agents that grants were no
longer to be had.</p>

<h3>RANNOCH.<br />

<span class="smcap">By</span> ALEXANDER MACKENZIE.</h3>
</div>

<p>Regarding the state of matters in this district a correspondent
writes us as follows:&mdash;I am very glad to learn
that you are soon to publish a new edition of your “Highland
Clearances.” You have done good work already in
rousing the conscience of the public against the conduct
of certain landlords in the Highlands, who long ere now
should have been held up to public scorn and execration,
as the best means of deterring others from pursuing a
policy which has been so fatal to the best interests of our
beloved land.... And now, if I am not too late,
I should like to direct your attention to a few authenticated
facts connected with two districts in the Highlands,
that I am familiar with, and which facts you may utilise,
though I shall merely give notes.</p>

<p>In 1851 the population of the district known as the
quoad sacra parish of Rannoch numbered altogether
1800; at the census of 1881 it was below 900. Even in
1851 it was not nearly what it was earlier. Why this
constant decrease? Several no doubt left the district
voluntarily; but the great bulk of those who left were
evicted.</p>

<p>Take, first, the Slios Min, north side of Loch Rannoch.
Fifty years ago the farm of Ardlarich, near the west end,
was tenanted by three farmers, who were in good circumstances.
These were turned out to make room for one
large farmer, who was rouped out last year, penniless;
and the farm is now tenantless. The next place, further
east, is the township of Killichoan, containing about
thirty to forty houses, with small crofts attached to each.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
The crofters here are very comfortable and happy, and
their houses and crofts are models of what industry,
thrift and good taste can effect. Further east is the farm
of Liaran, now tenantless. Fifty years ago it was farmed
by seven tenants who were turned out to make room for
one man, and that at a lower rent than was paid by the
former tenants. Further, in the same direction, there are
Aulich, Craganour, and Annat, every one of them tenantless.
These three farms, lately in the occupation of one
tenant, and for which he paid a rental of £900, at one time
maintained fifty to sixty families in comfort, all of whom
have vanished, or were virtually banished from their
native land.</p>

<p>It is only right to say that the present proprietor is not
responsible for the eviction of any of the smaller tenants;
the deed was done before he came into possession. On
the contrary, he is very kind to his crofter tenantry, but
unfortunately for him he inherits the fruits of a bad policy
which has been the ruin of the Rannoch estates.</p>

<p>Then take the Slios Garbh, south-side of Loch Rannoch.
Beginning in the west-end, we have Georgetown, which,
about fifty years ago, contained twenty-five or twenty-six
houses, every one of which were knocked down by the
late laird of Struan, and the people evicted. The crofters
of Finnart were ejected in the same way. Next comes
the township of Camghouran, a place pretty similar to
Killichoan, but smaller. The people are very industrious,
cleanly, and fairly comfortable, reflecting much credit
upon themselves and the present proprietor. Next
comes Dall, where there used to be a number of tenants,
but now in the hands of the proprietor, an Englishman.
The estate of Innerhaden comes next. It used to be
divided into ten lots&mdash;two held by the laird, and eight
by as many tenants. The whole is now in the hands of
one family. The rest of Bun-Rannoch includes the estates
of Dalchosnie, Lassintullich, and Crossmount,
where there used to be a large number of small tenants&mdash;most
of them well-to-do&mdash;but now held by five.</p>

<p>Lastly, take the north side of the river Dubhag, which
flows out from Loch Rannoch, and is erroneously called<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
the Tummel. Kinloch, Druimchurn, and Druimchaisteil,
always in the hands of three tenants, are now held by one.
Drumaglass contains a number of small holdings, with
good houses on many of them. Balmore, which always
had six tenants in it, has now only one, the remaining
portion of it being laid out in grass parks. Ballintuim,
with a good house upon it, is tenantless. Auchitarsin,
where there used to be twenty houses, is now reduced to
four. The whole district from, and including, Kinloch
to Auchitarsin belongs to General Sir Alastair Macdonald
of Dalchosnie, Commander of Her Majesty’s Forces in
Scotland. His father, Sir John, during his life, took a
great delight in having a numerous, thriving, and sturdy
tenantry on the estates of Dalchosnie, Kinloch, Lochgarry,
Dunalastair, and Morlaggan. On one occasion
his tenant of Dalchosnie offered to take from Sir John
on lease all the land on the north side of the river. “Ay,
man,” said he, “you would take all that land, would you,
and turn out all my people! Who would I get, if my
house took fire, to put it out?”</p>

<p>The present proprietor has virtually turned out the
great bulk of those that Sir John had loved so well.
Though, it is said, he did not evict any man directly, he
is alleged to have made their positions so hot for them that
they had to leave. Sir John could have raised hundreds
of Volunteers on his estates&mdash;men who would have died
for the gallant old soldier. But how many could be now
raised by his son? Not a dozen men; though he goes
about inspecting Volunteers and praising the movement
officially throughout the length and breadth of Scotland.</p>

<p>The author of the <cite>New Statistical Account</cite>, writing of the
Parish of Fortingall, of which the district referred to by
our correspondent forms a part, says:&mdash;“At present
[1838] no part of the parish is more populous than it was
in 1790; whereas in several districts, the population has
since decreased one-half; and the same will be found to
have taken place, though not perhaps in so great a proportion,
in most or all of the pastoral districts of the
county.”</p>

<p>According to the census of 1801 the population was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
3875; in 1811, 3236; in 1821, 3189; in 1831, 3067; and
in 1881 it was reduced to 1690.</p>

<p>Upwards of 120 families, the same writer says, “crossed
the Atlantic from this parish, since the previous Account
was drawn up [in 1791], besides many individuals of both
sexes; while many others have sought a livelihood in the
Low Country, especially in the great towns of Edinburgh,
Glasgow, Dundee, Perth, Crieff, and others. The system
of uniting several farms together, and letting them to one
individual, has more than any other circumstance” produced
this result.</p>

<h3>BREADALBANE.</h3>

<p>Mr. R. Alister, author of <cite>Barriers to the National
Prosperity of Scotland</cite>, had a controversy with the Marquis
of Breadalbane in 1853, about the eviction of his tenantry.
In a letter, dated July of that year, Mr. Alister made a
charge against his lordship which, for obvious reasons, he
never attempted to answer, as <span class="lock">follows:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>“Your lordship states that in reality there has been no
depopulation of the district. This, and other
parts of your lordship’s letter, would certainly
lead any who know nothing of the facts to suppose
that there had been no clearings on the Breadalbane
estates; whereas it is generally believed that
your lordship removed, since 1834, no less than 500
families! Some may think this is a small matter; but
I do not. I think it is a great calamity for a family to be
thrown out, destitute of the means of life, without a roof
over their heads, and cast upon the wide sea of an unfeeling
world. In Glenqueich, near Amulree, some sixty
families formerly lived, where there are now only four or
five; and in America, there is a glen inhabited by its
ousted tenants, and called Glenqueich still. Yet, forsooth,
it is maintained there has been no depopulation
here! The desolations here look like the ruins of Irish
cabins, although the population of Glenqueich were
always characterised as being remarkably thrifty, economical,
and wealthy. On the Braes of Taymouth, at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
the back of Drummond Hill, and at Tullochyoule, some
forty or fifty families formerly resided, where there is not
one now! Glenorchy, by the returns of 1831, showed a
population of 1806; in 1841, 831;&mdash;is there no depopulation
there? Is it true that in Glenetive there were
sixteen tenants a year or two ago, where there is not a
single one now? Is it true, my lord, that you purchased
an island on the west coast, called Luing, where some
twenty-five families lived at the beginning <em>of this year</em>,
but who are now cleared off to make room for one tenant,
for whom an extensive steading is now being erected?
If my information be correct, I shall allow the public to
draw their own conclusions; but, from every thing that
I have heard, I believe that your lordship has done more
to exterminate the Scottish peasantry than any man now
living; and perhaps you ought to be ranked next to the
Marquis of Stafford in the unenviable clearing celebrities.
If I have over-estimated the clearances at 500 families,
please to correct me.” As we have already said, his lordship
thought it prudent, and by far the best policy, not
to make the attempt.</p>

<p>In another letter the same writer <span class="lock">says:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>“You must be aware that your late father raised
2300 men during the last war, and that 1600 of
that number were from the Breadalbane estates.
My statement is, that 150 could not <em>now</em> be raised.
Your lordship has most carefully evaded all allusion
to this,&mdash;perhaps the worst charge of the whole.
From your lordship’s silence I am surely justified
in concluding that you may endeavour to evade
the question, but you dare not attempt an open contradiction.
I have often made inquiries of Highlanders on
this point, and the number above stated was the <em>highest</em>
estimate. Many who should know, state to me that
your lordship would not get <em>fifty</em> followers from the whole
estates; and another says:&mdash;‘Why, he would not get
half-a-dozen, and not one of them unless they could not
possibly do otherwise.’ This, then, is the position of
the question: in 1793-4, there was such a numerous,
hardy, and industrious population on the Breadalbane<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
estates, that there could be spared of valorous defenders
of their country in her hour of danger, 1600; highest
estimate now, 150; highest banished, 1450. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Per
contra</i>&mdash;Game of all sorts increased a hundred-fold.”</p>

<p>In 1831, Glenorchy, of which his lordship of Breadalbane
was proprietor, was 1806; in 1841 it was reduced to
831. Those best acquainted with the Breadalbane estates
assert that on the whole property no less than 500
families, or about 2500 souls, were driven into exile by the
hard-hearted Marquis of that day.</p>

<p>It is, however, gratifying to know that the present Lord
Breadalbane, who is descended from a different and remote
branch of the family, is an excellent landlord, and
takes an entirely different view of his duties and relationship
to the tenants on his vast property.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">The Rev. Dr.</span> MACLACHLAN.</h3>

</div>

<p>The late Rev. Dr. Maclachlan, Edinburgh, wrote a
series of articles in the <cite>Witness</cite>, during its palmy days
under the editorship of Hugh Miller. These were afterwards
published in 1849, under the title of “The Depopulation
System of the Highlands,” in pamphlet form,
by Johnston and Hunter. The rev. author visited all
the places to which he refers. He <span class="lock">says:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>“A complete history of Highland clearances would, we
doubt not, both interest and surprise the British public.
Men talk of the Sutherland clearings as if they stood
alone amidst the atrocities of the system; but those who
know fully the facts of the case can speak with as much
truth of the Ross-shire clearings, the Inverness-shire
clearings, the Perthshire clearings, and, to some extent,
the Argyllshire clearings. The earliest of these was the
great clearing on the Glengarry estate, towards, we believe,
the latter end of the last century. The tradition
among the Highlanders is (and some Gaelic poems composed
at the time would go to confirm it), that the chief’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
lady had taken umbrage at the clan. Whatever the
cause might have been, the offence was deep, and could
only be expiated by the extirpation of the race. Summonses
of ejection were served over the whole property,
even on families the most closely connected with the
chief; and if we now seek for the Highlanders of Glengarry,
we must search on the banks of the St. Lawrence.</p>

<p>“To the westward of Glengarry lies the estate of Lochiel&mdash;a
name to which the imperishable poetry of Campbell
has attached much interest. It is the country of the brave
clan Cameron, to whom, were there nothing to speak of
but their conduct at Waterloo, Britain owes a debt.
Many of our readers have passed along Loch Lochy, and
they have likely had the mansion of Auchnacarry pointed
out to them, and they have been told of the Dark Mile,
surpassing, as some say, the Trossachs in romantic
beauty; but perhaps they were not aware that beyond
lies the wide expanse of Loch Arkaig, whose banks have
been the scene of a most extensive clearing. There was
a day when three hundred able, active men could have
been collected from the shores of this extensive inland
loch; but eviction has long ago rooted them out, and
nothing is now to be seen but the ruins of their huts, with
the occasional bothy of a shepherd, while their lands are
held by one or two farmers from the borders.</p>

<p>“Crossing to the south of the great glen, we may
begin with Glencoe. How much of its romantic
interest does this glen owe to its desolation? Let
us remember, however, that the desolation, in a
large part of it, is the result of the extrusion of
the inhabitants. Travel eastward, and the footprints
of the destroyer cannot be lost sight of. Large tracks
along the Spean and its tributaries are a wide waste.
The southern bank of Loch Lochy is almost without
inhabitants, though the symptoms of former occupancy
are frequent.</p>

<p>“When we enter the country of the Frasers,
the same spectacle presents itself&mdash;a desolate land.
With the exception of the miserable village of Fort-Augustus
the native population is almost extinguished,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
while those who do remain are left as if, by their squalid
misery, to make darkness the more visible. Across the
hills, in Stratherrick, the property of Lord Lovat, with
the exception of a few large sheep farmers, and a very
few tenants, is one wide waste. To the north of Loch
Ness, the territory of the Grants, both Glenmoriston and
the Earl of Seafield, presents a pleasing feature amidst
the sea of desolation. But beyond this, again, let us
trace the large rivers of the east coast to their sources.</p>

<p>“Trace the Beauly through all its upper reaches, and
how many thousands upon thousands of acres, once
peopled, are, as respects human beings, a wide wilderness!
The lands of the Chisholm have been stripped of their
population down to a mere fragment; the possessors of
those of Lovat have not been behind with their share of
the same sad doings. Let us cross to the Conon and its
branches, and we will find that the chieftains of the
Mackenzies have not been less active in extermination.
Breadalbane and Rannoch, in Perthshire, have a similar
tale to tell, vast masses of the population having been
forcibly expelled. The upper portions of Athole have also
suffered, while many of the valleys along the Spey and its
tributaries are without an inhabitant, if we except a few
shepherds. Sutherland, with all its atrocities, affords
but a fraction of the atrocities that have been perpetrated
in following out the ejectment system of the Highlands.
In truth, of the habitable portion of the whole country
but a small part is now really inhabited. We are unwilling
to weary our readers by carrying them along the west
coast from the Linnhe Loch, northwards; but if they
inquire, they will find that the same system has been,
in the case of most of the estates, relentlessly pursued.</p>

<p>“These are facts of which, we believe, the British public
know little, but they are facts on which the changes
should be rung until they have listened to them and
seriously considered them. May it not be that part of the
guilt is theirs, who might, yet did not, step forward to
stop such cruel and unwise proceedings?</p>

<p>“Let us leave the past, however” he continues, “and
consider the present. And it is a melancholy reflection<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
that the year 1849 has added its long list to the roll of
Highland ejectments. While the law is banishing its
tens for terms of seven or fourteen years, as the penalty
of deep-dyed crimes, irresponsible and infatuated power
is banishing its thousands for life for no crime whatever.
This year brings forward, as leader in the work of expatriation,
the Duke of Argyll. Is it possible that his
vast possessions are over-densely peopled? “<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Credat
Judæus appelles.</i>” And the Highland Destitution
Committee co-operate. We had understood that the
large sums of money at their disposal had been given them
for the purpose of relieving, and not of banishing, the
destitute. Next we have Mr. Baillie of Glenelg, professedly
at their own request, sending five hundred souls
off to America. Their native glen must have been made
not a little uncomfortable for these poor people, ere they
could have petitioned for so sore a favour. Then we have
Colonel Gordon expelling upwards of eighteen hundred
souls from South Uist; Lord Macdonald follows with a
sentence of banishment against six or seven hundred
of the people of North Uist, with a threat, as we learn,
that three thousand are to be driven from Skye next
season; and Mr. Lillingston of Lochalsh, Maclean of
Ardgour, and Lochiel, bring up the rear of the black
catalogue, a large body of people having left the estates
of the two latter, who, after a heart-rending scene of
parting with their native land, are now on the wide sea
on their way to Australia. Thus, within the last three
or four months, considerably upwards of three thousand
of the most moral and loyal of our people&mdash;people who,
even in the most trying circumstances, never required a
soldier, seldom a policeman, among them, to maintain the
peace&mdash;are driven forcibly away to seek subsistence on a
foreign soil.”</p>

<p>Writing in 1850, on more “Recent Highland
Evictions,” the same author <span class="lock">says:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>“The moral responsibility for these transactions
lies in a measure with the nation, and not merely
with the individuals immediately concerned in
them. Some years ago the fearful scenes that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
attended the slave trade were depicted in colours
that finally roused the national conscience, and the
nation gave its loud, indignant, and effective testimony
against them. The tearing of human beings, with hearts
as warm, and affections as strong as dwell in the bosom
of the white man, from their beloved homes and families&mdash;the
packing them into the holds of over-crowded vessels,
in the burning heat of the tropics&mdash;the stifling atmosphere,
the clanking chain, the pestilence, the bodies of the dead
corrupting in the midst of the living&mdash;presented a picture
which deeply moved the national mind; and there was
felt to be guilt, deep-dyed guilt, and the nation relieved
itself by abolishing the traffic. And is the nation free of
guilt in this kind of white-slave traffic that is now going
on&mdash;this tearing of men whether they will or not, from
their country and kindred&mdash;this crowding them into
often foul and unwholesome vessels with the accompanying
deaths of hundreds whose eyes never rest on the land
to which they are driven. Men may say that they have
rights in the one case that they have not in the other.
Then we say that they are rights into whose nature and
fruits we would do well to enquire, lest it be found that
the rude and lawless barbarism of Africa, and the high
and boasted civilisation of Britain, land us in the same
final results.... It is to British legislation that the
people of the Highlands owe the relative position in which
they stand to their chiefs. There was a time when they
were strangers to the feudal system which prevailed in the
rest of the kingdom. Every man among them sat as
free as his chief. But by degrees the power of the latter,
assisted by Saxon legislation, encroached upon the liberty
of the former. Highland chiefs became feudal lords&mdash;the
people were robbed to increase their power&mdash;and now we
are reaping the fruits of this in recent evictions.”</p>

<p>At a meeting of the Inverness, Ross, and Nairn Club, in
Edinburgh, in 1877, the venerable Doctor referred to the
same sad subject amid applause and expressions of regret.
We extract the following from a report of the meeting
which appeared at the time in the <cite>Inverness Courier</cite>:&mdash;</p>

<p>“The current that ran against their language seemed to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
be rising against the people themselves. The cry seemed
to be, Do away with the people: this is the shorthand
way of doing away with the language. He reminded
them of the saying of a queen, that she would turn Scotland
into a hunting field, and of the reply of a Duke of
Argyll it is time for me to make my hounds ready,
and said he did not know whether there was now an Argyll
who would make the same reply. But there were other
folks&mdash;less folks than queens&mdash;who had gone pretty deep
in the direction indicated by this queen. He would not
say it was not a desirable thing to see Highlanders
scattered over the earth&mdash;they were greatly indebted to
them in their cities and the colonies; but he wished to
preserve their Highland homes, from which the colonies
and large cities derived their very best blood. Drive off
the Highlander and destroy his home, and you destroy
that which had produced some of the best and noblest
men who filled important positions throughout the empire.
In the interests of great cities, as a citizen of
Edinburgh, he desired to keep the Highlanders in their
own country, and to make them as comfortable as
possible. He only wished that some of the Highland proprietors
could see their way to offer sections of the land
for improvement by the people, who were quite as able
to improve the land in their own country as to improve
the great forests of Canada. He himself would rather
to-morrow begin to cultivate an acre in any habitable
part of the Highlands of Scotland than to begin to cultivate
land such as that on which he had seen thousands
of them working in the forests of Canada. What had all
this to do with Celtic Literature? Dr. Maclachlan
replied that the whole interest which Celtic Literature had
to him was connected with the Celtic people, and if they
destroyed the Celtic people, his entire interest in their
literature perished. They had been told the other day
that this was sentiment, and that there were cases in
which sentiment was not desirable. He agreed with this
so far; but he believed that when sentiment was driven
out of a Highlander the best part of him was driven out,
for it ever had a strong place among mountain people.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
He himself had a warm patriotic feeling, and he grieved
whenever he saw a ruined house in any of their mountain
glens. And ruined homes and ruined villages he, alas!
had seen&mdash;villages on fire&mdash;the hills red with burning
homes. He never wished to see this sorry sight again.
It was a sad, a lamentable sight, for he was convinced
the country had not a nobler class of people than the
Highland people, or a set of people better worth preserving.”</p>

<h3>A HIGHLAND SHERIFF.</h3>

<p>Mr. Robert Brown, Sheriff-Substitute of the Western
District of Inverness-shire, in 1806, wrote a pamphlet of
120 pages, now very scarce, entitled, “Strictures and
Remarks on the Earl of Selkirk’s ‘Observations on the
Present State of the Highlands of Scotland,’” Sheriff
Brown was a man of keen observation, and his work
is a powerful argument against the forced depopulation
of the country. Summing up the number who left from
1801 to 1803, he <span class="lock">says:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>“In the year 1801, a Mr. George Dennon, from Pictou,
carried out two cargoes of emigrants from Fort William
to Pictou, consisting of about seven hundred souls. A
vessel sailed the same season from Isle Martin with about
one hundred passengers, it is believed, for the same
place. No more vessels sailed that year; but in 1802,
eleven large ships sailed with emigrants to America.
Of these, four were from Fort William, one from Knoydart,
one from Isle Martin, one from Uist, one from
Greenock. Five of these were bound for Canada, four
for Pictou, and one for Cape Breton. The only remaining
vessel, which took a cargo of people in Skye, sailed for
Wilmington, in the United States. In the year 1803,
exclusive of Lord Selkirk’s transport, eleven cargoes
of emigrants went from the North Highlands. Of these,
four were from the Moray Firth, two from Ullapool,
three from Stornoway, and two from Fort William.
The whole of these cargoes were bound for the British
settlements, and most of them were discharged at Pictou.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span></p>

<p>Soon after, several other vessels sailed from the North
West Highlands with emigrants, the whole of whom were
for the British Colonies. In addition to these, Lord
Selkirk took out 250 from South Uist in 1802, and in 1803
he sent out to Prince Edward Island about 800 souls, in
three different vessels, most of whom were from the Island
of Skye, and the remainder from Ross-shire, North Argyll,
the interior of the County of Inverness, and the Island of
Uist. In 1804, 1805, and 1806, several cargoes of Highlanders
left Mull, Skye, and other Western Islands, for
Prince Edward Island and other North American
Colonies. Altogether, not less than 10,000 souls left the
West Highlands and Isles during the first six years of the
present century, a fact which will now appear incredible.</p>

<h3>THE WIZARD OF THE NORTH.</h3>

<p>Sir Walter Scott writes:&mdash;“In too many instances
the Highlands have been drained, not of their superfluity
of population, but of the whole mass of the
inhabitants, dispossessed by an unrelenting avarice,
which will be one day found to have been as shortsighted
as it is unjust and selfish. Meantime, the
Highlands may become the fairy ground for romance
and poetry, or the subject of experiment for the
professors of speculation, political and economical. But
if the hour of need should come&mdash;and it may not, perhaps,
be far distant&mdash;the pibroch may sound through the
deserted region, but the summons will remain unanswered.”</p>

<h3>A CONTINENTAL HISTORIAN.</h3>

<p>M. Michelet, the great Continental historian, writes:&mdash;“The
Scottish Highlanders will ere long disappear
from the face of the earth; the mountains are
daily depopulating; the great estates have ruined
the land of the Gael, as they did ancient Italy.
The Highlander will ere long exist only in the
romances of Walter Scott. The tartan and the claymore
excite surprise in the streets of Edinburgh; the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
Highlanders disappear&mdash;they emigrate&mdash;their national
airs will ere long be lost, as the music of the Eolian harp
when the winds are hushed.”</p>

<h3>MR. ALFRED RUSSEL WALLACE.</h3>

<p>In his work on the Nationalisation of Land, Mr. Alfred
Russel Wallace, in the chapter on “Landlordism in
Scotland,” says to the English <span class="lock">people:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>“The facts stated in this chapter will possess,
I feel sure, for many Englishmen, an almost
startling novelty; the tale of oppression and cruelty
they reveal reads like one of those hideous stories
peculiar to the dark ages, rather than a simple
record of events happening upon our own land and
within the memory of the present generation. For a
parallel to this monstrous power of the landowner, under
which life and property are entirely at his mercy, we must
go back to mediæval, or to the days when serfdom not
having been abolished, the Russian noble was armed with
despotic authority; while the more pitiful results of this
landlord tyranny, the wide devastation of cultivated
lands, the heartless burning of houses, the reckless creation
of pauperism and misery, out of well-being and
contentment, could only be expected under the rule of
Turkish Sultans or greedy and cruel Pashas. Yet these
cruel deeds have been perpetrated in one of the most
beautiful portions of our native land. They are not the
work of uncultured barbarians or of fanatic Moslems, but
of so-called civilised and Christian men; and&mdash;worst
feature of all&mdash;they are not due to any high-handed exercise
of power beyond the law, but are strictly legal, are
in many cases the acts of members of the Legislature
itself, and, notwithstanding that they have been
repeatedly made known for at least sixty years past, no
steps have been taken, or are even proposed to be taken,
by the Legislature to prevent them for the future!
Surely it is time that the people of England should declare
that such things shall no longer exist&mdash;that the rich shall
no longer have such legal power to oppress the poor&mdash;that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
the land shall be free for all who are willing to pay a fair
value for its use&mdash;and, as this is not possible under
landlordism, that landlordism shall be abolished....</p>

<p>“The general results of the system of modern landlordism
in Scotland are not less painful than the hardship and
misery brought upon individual sufferers. The earlier
improvers, who drove the peasants from their sheltered
valleys to the exposed sea-coast, in order to make room
for sheep and sheep farmers, pleaded erroneously the
public benefit as the justification of their conduct. They
maintained that more food and clothing would be produced
by the new system, and that the people themselves
would have the advantage of the produce of the sea as
well as that of the land for their support. The result,
however, proved them to be mistaken, for henceforth
the cry of Highland destitution began to be heard, culminating
at intervals into actual famines, like that of
1836-37, when £70,000 were distributed to keep the
Highlanders from death by starvation. ... just as
in Ireland, there was abundance of land capable of cultivation,
but the people were driven to the coast and to the
towns to make way for sheep, and cattle, and lowland
farmers; and when the barren and inhospitable tracts
allotted to them became overcrowded, they were told to
emigrate. As the Rev. J. Macleod says:&mdash;“By the
clearances one part is depopulation and the other overpopulated;
the people are gathered into villages where
there is no steady employment for them, where idleness
has its baneful influence and lands them in penury and
want.</p>

<p>“The actual effect of this system of eviction and emigration&mdash;of
banishing the native of the soil and giving it to
the stranger&mdash;is shown in the steady increase of poverty
indicated by the amount spent for the relief of the poor
having increased from less than £300,000 in 1846 to more
than £900,000 now; while in the same period the population
has only increased from 2,770,000 to 3,627,000, so
that pauperism has grown about nine times faster than
population!... The fact that a whole population
could be driven from their homes like cattle at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
will of a landlord, and that the Government which taxed
them, and for whom they freely shed their blood on the
battle-field, neither would nor could protect them from
cruel interference with their personal liberty, is surely the
most convincing and most absolute demonstration of the
incompatibility of landlordism with the elementary
rights of a free people.</p>

<p>“As if, however, to prove this still more clearly, and to
show how absolutely incompatible with the well-being
of the community is modern landlordism, the great lords
of the soil in Scotland have for the last twenty years or
more been systematically laying waste enormous areas
of land for purposes of sport, just as the Norman Conqueror
laid waste the area of the New Forest for similar
purposes. At the present time, more than two million
acres of Scottish soil are devoted to the preservation of
deer alone&mdash;an area larger than the entire Counties of
Kent and Surrey combined. Glen Tilt Forest includes
100,000 acres; the Black Mount is sixty miles in circumference;
and Ben Alder Forest is fifteen miles long by
seven broad. On many of these forests there is the finest
pasture in Scotland, while the valleys would support a
considerable population of small farmers, yet all this land
is devoted to the sport of the wealthy, farms being destroyed,
houses pulled down, and men, sheep, and cattle
all banished to create a wilderness for the deer-stalkers!
At the same time the whole people of England are shut
out from many of the grandest and most interesting scenes
of their native land, gamekeepers and watchers forbidding
the tourist or naturalist to trespass on some of the wildest
Scotch mountains.</p>

<p>“Now, when we remember that the right to a property
in these unenclosed mountains was most unjustly given to
the representatives of the Highland chiefs little more
than a century ago, and that they and their successors
have grossly abused their power ever since, it is surely
time to assert those fundamental maxims of jurisprudence
which state that&mdash;“No man can have a vested right in the
misfortunes and woes of his country,” and that “the
Sovereign ought not to allow either communities or pri<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>vate
individuals to acquire large tracts of land in order
to leave it uncultivated.” If the oft-repeated maxim
that “property has its duties as well as its rights” is not
altogether a mockery, then we maintain that in this case
the <em>total</em> neglect of all the duties devolving on the owners
of these vast tracts of land affords ample reason why the
State should take possession of them for the public benefit.
A landlord government will, of course, never do this
till the people declare unmistakably that it must be done.
To such a government the rights of property are <em>sacred</em>,
while those of their fellow-citizens are of comparatively
little moment; but we feel sure that when the people fully
know and understand the doings of the landlords of Scotland,
the reckless destruction of homesteads, and the
silent sufferings of the brave Highlanders, they will make
their will known, and, when they do so, that <em>will</em> must
soon be embodied into law.”</p>

<p>After quoting the opinion of the Rev. Dr. John
Kennedy of Dingwall, given at length on other pages,
Mr. Wallace next quotes from an article in the <cite>Westminster
Review</cite>, in 1868. “The Gaels,” this writer says,
“rooted from the dawn of history on the slopes of the
northern mountains, have been thinned out and thrown
away like young turnips too thickly planted. Noble
gentlemen and noble ladies have shown a flintiness of
heart and a meanness of detail in carrying out their
clearings, upon which it is revolting to dwell; and after
all, are the evils of over-population cured? Does not the
disease still spring up under the very torture of the knife?
Are not the crofts slowly and silently taken at every
opportunity out of the hands of the peasantry? When a
Highlander has to leave his hut there is now no resting-place
for him save the cellars or attics of the closes of
Glasgow, or some other large centre of employment; it
has been noticed that the poor Gael is even more liable
than the Irishman to sink under the debasement in which
he is then immersed.” The same writer holds:&mdash;“No
error could be grosser than that of reviewing the chiefs as
unlimited proprietors not only of the land, but of the
whole territory of the mountain, lake, river, and sea-shore,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
held and won during hundreds of years by the broad
swords of the clansmen. Could any Maclean admit,
even in a dream, that his chief could clear Mull of all the
Macleans and replace them with Campbells; or the
Mackintosh people his lands with Macdonalds, and drive
away his own race, any more than Louis Napoleon could
evict all the population of France and supply their place
with English and German colonists?” Yet this very
power and right the English Government, in its aristocratic
selfishness, bestowed upon the chiefs, when, after
the great rebellion of 1745, it took away their privileges
of war and criminal jurisdiction, and endeavoured to
assimilate them to the nobles and great landowners of
England. The rights of the clansmen were left entirely
out of consideration.<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a></p>

<h3>A FRENCH ECONOMIST.</h3>

<p>The following remarks by the celebrated French
economist, M. de Lavaleye, will prove interesting. There
is no greater living authority on land tenure than this
writer, and being a foreigner, his opinions are not open&mdash;as
the opinions of our own countrymen may be&mdash;to the
suspicion of political bias or partisanship on a question
which is of universal interest all over the world. Referring
to land tenure in this country, he <span class="lock">says:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>“The dispossession of the old proprietors, transformed
by time into new tenants, was effected on a larger scale by
the “clearing of estates.” When a lord of the manor, for
his own profit, wanted to turn the small holdings into
large farms, or into pasturage, the small cultivators were
of no use. The proprietors adopted a simple means of
getting rid of them; and, by destroying their dwellings,
forced them into exile. The classical land of this system
is Ireland, or more particularly the Highlands of Scotland.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span></p>
<p>“It is now clearly established that in Scotland, just as in
Ireland, the soil was once the property of the clan or sept.
The chiefs of the clan had certain rights over the communal
domain; but they were even further from being
proprietors than was Louis XIV. from being proprietor
of the territory of France. By successive encroachments,
however, they transformed their authority of suzerain
into a right of private ownership, without even recognising
in their old co-proprietors a right of hereditary possession.
In a similar way the Zemindars and Talugdars
in India were, by the Act of the British Government,
transformed into absolute proprietors. Until modern
days the chiefs of the clan were interested in retaining a
large number of vassals, as their power, and often their
security, were only guaranteed by their arms. But
when the order was established, and the chiefs&mdash;or lords,
as they now were&mdash;began to reside in the towns, and required
large revenues rather than numerous retainers,
they endeavoured to introduce large farms and pasturage.</p>

<p>“We may follow the first phases of this revolution, which
commences after the last rising under the Pretender, in
the works of James Anderson, and James Stuart. The
latter tells us that in his time&mdash;in the last third of the
18th century&mdash;the Highlands of Scotland still presented
a miniature picture of the Europe of four hundred years
ago. The rent (so he misnames the tribute paid to
the chief of the clan) of these lands is very little in comparison
with their extent, but if it is regarded relatively
to the number of mouths which the farm supports, it
will be seen that land in the Scotch Highlands supports
perhaps twice as many persons as land of the same value
in a fertile province. When, in the last thirty years of
the 18th century, they began to expel the Gaels, they at
the same time forbade them to emigrate to a foreign
country, so as to compel them by these means to congregate
in Glasgow and other manufacturing towns.</p>

<p>“In his observations on Smith’s <cite>Wealth of Nations</cite>, published
in 1814, David Buchanan gives us an idea of the progress
made by the clearing of estates. ‘In the Highlands,’
he says, ‘the landed proprietor, without regard to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
hereditary tenants’ (he wrongly applies this term to the
clansmen who were joint proprietors of the soil), ‘offers
the land to the highest bidder, who, if he wishes to improve
the cultivation, is anxious for nothing but the introduction
of a new system. The soil, dotted with small
peasant proprietors, was formerly well populated in proportion
to its natural fertility. The new system of improved
agriculture and increased rents demands the
greatest net profit with the least possible outlay, and with
this object the cultivators are got rid of as being of no
further use. Thus cast from their native soil, they go to
seek their living in the manufacturing towns.’</p>

<p>“George Ensor, in a work published in 1818, says:&mdash;They
(the landed proprietors of Scotland) dispossessed families
as they would grub up coppice-wood, and they treated
the villages and their people as Indians harassed with
wild beasts do in their vengeance a jungle with tigers....
Is it credible, that in the 18th century, in this
missionary age, in this Christian era, man shall be bartered
for a fleece or a carcase of mutton&mdash;nay, held
cheaper?... Why, how much worse is it than
the intention of the Moguls, who, when they had broken
into the northern provinces of China, proposed in Council
to exterminate the inhabitants, and convert the land into
pasture? This proposal many Highland proprietors
have effected in their own country against their own countrymen.</p>

<p>“M. de Sismondi has rendered celebrated on the Continent
the famous clearing executed between 1814 and
1820 by the Duchess of Sutherland. More than three
thousand families were driven out; and 800,000 acres of
land, which formerly belonged to the clan, were transformed
into seignorial domain. Men were driven out to
make room for sheep. The sheep are now replaced by
deer, and the pastures converted into deer forests, which
are treeless solitudes. The <cite>Economist</cite> of June 2, 1866,
said on this subject:&mdash;Feudal instincts have as full
career now as in the time when the Conqueror destroyed
thirty-six villages to make the New Forest. Two
millions of acres, comprising most fertile land, have been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
changed into desert. The natural herbage in Glen Tilt
was known as the most succulent in Perth; the deer
forest of Ben Alder was the best natural meadow of
Badenoch; the forest of Black Mount was the best
pasturage in Scotland for black-woolled sheep. The soil
thus sacrificed for the pleasures of the chase extends
over an area larger than the county of Perth. The land
in the new Ben Alder forest supported 15,000 sheep; and
this is but the thirtieth part of the territory sacrificed,
and thus rendered as unproductive as if it were buried
in the depths of the sea.</p>

<p>“The destruction of small property is still going on, no
longer, however, by encroachment, but by purchase.
Whenever land comes into the market it is bought by
some rich capitalist, because the expenses of legal inquiry
are too great for a small investment. Thus, large properties
are consolidated, and fall, so to speak, into mortmain,
in consequence of the law of primogeniture and
entails. In the 15th century, according to Chancellor
Fortescue, England was quoted throughout Europe for its
number of proprietors and the comfort of its inhabitants.
In 1688, Gregory King estimates that there were 180,000
proprietors, exclusive of 16,560 proprietors of noble rank.
In 1786 there were 250,000 proprietors of England.
According to the “Domesday Book” of 1876, there were
170,000 rural proprietors in England owning above an
acre; 21,000 in Ireland, and 8000 in Scotland. A fifth
of the entire country is in the hands of 523 persons.
Are you aware, said Mr. Bright, in a speech delivered
at Birmingham, August 27, 1866, that one-half of the
soil of Scotland belongs to ten or twelve persons? Are
you aware of the fact that the monopoly of landed property
is continually increasing and becoming more and
more exclusive?</p>

<p>“In England, then, as at Rome, large property has
swallowed up small property, in consequence of a continuous
evolution unchecked from the beginning to the
end of the nation’s history; and the social order seems
to be threatened just as in the Roman Empire.</p>

<p>“An ardent desire for a more equal division of the pro<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>duce
of labour inflames the labouring classes, and passes
from land to land. In England, it arouses agitation
among the industrial classes, and is beginning to invade
the rural districts. It obviously menaces landed property
as constituted in this country. The labourers who till
the soil will claim their share in it; and, if they fail to
obtain it here, will cross the sea in search of it. To retain
a hold on them they must be given a vote; and there is
fresh danger in increasing the number of electors while
that of proprietors diminishes, and maintaining laws
which renders inequality greater and more striking, while
ideas of equality are assuming more formidable sway.
To make the possession of the soil a closed monopoly
and to augment the political powers of the class who are
rigidly excluded, is at once to provoke levelling measures
and to facilitate them. Accordingly we find that England
is the country where the scheme of the nationalisation of
the land finds most adherents, and is most widely proclaimed.
The country which is furthest from the primitive
organisations of property is likewise the one where
the social order seems most menaced.”</p>

<h3>MR. JOSEPH CHAMBERLAIN.</h3>

<p>In a speech delivered at Inverness, on 18th September,
1885, Mr. Joseph Chamberlain <span class="lock">said:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>“The history of the Highland clearances is a black page
in the account with private ownership in land, and if it
were to form a precedent, if there could be any precedent
for wrong-doing, if the sins of the fathers ought to be
visited upon the children, we should have an excuse for
more drastic legislation than any which the wildest reformer
has ever proposed. Thousands of industrious,
hard-working, God-fearing people were driven from the
lands which had belonged to their ancestors, and which
for generations they had cultivated; their houses were
unroofed and destroyed, they were turned out homeless
and forlorn, exposed to the inclemency of the winter
season, left to perish on the hillsides or to swell the full
flood of misery and destitution in the cities to which they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
were driven for refuge. In some cases the cruel kindness
of their landlords provided the means of emigration&mdash;in
some cases they were actually driven abroad. They
suffered greatly in foreign countries, being unprovided
with the means of sustaining themselves until they could
earn a livelihood, but the descendants of those who survived
have contributed in no mean degree to the prosperity
of the countries in which they finally settled.
Those who remained behind had, I am afraid, little cause
to be grateful for the consideration which was shown to
them. In the course of years they were deprived of all
the advantages which they had previously enjoyed.
They had never had legal security of tenure, and they
were transferred from their original holdings in the glens
and straths, which at one time resounded with their industry,
and they were placed out upon barren patches
on the sea-shore where it was impossible for the most
exacting toil and industry to obtain a subsistence. The
picture that I have drawn was no doubt relieved in some
cases by the exceptional generosity and kindness of particular
proprietors, but, speaking generally, I think it
is the fact that the Highland country was to a considerable
extent depopulated by those clearances. The
general condition of the people suffered, and it has gone on
deteriorating until it has become at last a matter of
national concern. If I am correct in the statement in
which I have endeavoured to summarise what I have read,
and learned upon this subject, I ask you whether it is not
time that we should submit to careful examination and
review a system which places such vast powers for evil in
the hands of irresponsible individuals, and which makes
the possession of land not a trust but a means of extortion
and exaction?”</p>

<h3>HARDSHIPS ENDURED BY FIRST
EMIGRANTS.<br />

<span class="smcap">By</span> Alexander MACKENZIE.</h3>

<p>The reader is already acquainted with the misery
endured by those evicted from Barra and South Uist by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>
Colonel Gordon, after their arrival in Canada. This was
no isolated case. We shall here give a few instances of
the unspeakable suffering of those pioneers who left so
early as 1773, in the ship <i>Hector</i>, for Pictou, Nova Scotia,
gathered from trustworthy sources during the writer’s
late visit to that country. The <i>Hector</i> was owned by two
men, Pagan and Witherspoon, who bought three shares
of land in Pictou, and they engaged a Mr. John Ross as
their agent, to accompany the vessel to Scotland, to bring
out as many colonists as could be induced, by misrepresentation
and falsehoods, to leave their homes. They
offered a free passage, a farm, and a year’s free provisions
to their dupes. On his arrival in Scotland, Ross drew a
glowing picture of the land and other manifold advantages
of the country to which he was enticing the
people.</p>

<p>The Highlanders knew nothing of the difficulties awaiting
them in a land covered over with a dense unbroken
forest; and, tempted by the prospect of owning splendid
farms of their own, they were imposed upon by his promise,
and many of them agreed to accompany him across
the Atlantic and embraced his proposals. Calling first at
Greenock, three families and five single young men joined
the vessel at that port. She then sailed to Lochbroom,
in Ross-shire, where she received 33 families and 25
single men, the whole of her passengers numbering about
200 souls. This band, in the beginning of July, 1773,
bade a final farewell to their native land, not a soul on
board having ever crossed the Atlantic except a single
sailor and John Ross, the agent. As they were leaving,
a piper came on board who had not paid his passage;
the captain ordered him ashore, but the strains of the
national instrument affected those on board so much that
they pleaded to have him allowed to accompany them,
and offered to share their own rations with him in exchange
for his music during the passage. Their request
was granted, and his performances aided in no small
degree to cheer the noble band of pioneers in their long
voyage of eleven weeks, in a miserable hulk, across the
Atlantic.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span></p>

<p>The pilgrim band kept up their spirits as best
they could by song, pipe-music, dancing, wrestling, and
other amusements, through the long and painful voyage.
The ship was so rotten that the passengers could pick the
wood out of her sides with their fingers. They met with a
severe gale off the Newfoundland coast, and were driven
back by it so far that it took them about fourteen days to
get back to the point at which the storm met them. The
accommodation was wretched, smallpox and dysentry
broke out among the passengers. Eighteen of the
children died, and were committed to the deep amidst
such anguish and heart-rending agony as only a Highlander
can understand. Their stock of provisions became
almost exhausted, the water became scarce and bad;
the remnant of provisions left consisted mainly of salt
meat, which, from the scarcity of water, added greatly
to their sufferings. The oatcake carried by them became
mouldy, so that much of it had been thrown away
before they dreamt of having such a long passage.
Fortunately for them, one of the passengers, Hugh Macleod,
more prudent than the others, gathered up the
despised scraps into a bag, and during the last few days
of the voyage his fellows were too glad to join him in devouring
this refuse to keep souls and bodies together.</p>

<p>At last the <i>Hector</i> dropped anchor in the harbour,
opposite where the town of Pictou now stands. Though
the Highland dress was then proscribed at home, this
emigrant band carried theirs along with them, and, in
celebration of their arrival, many of the younger men
donned their national dress&mdash;to which a few of them were
able to add the <i lang="gd" xml:lang="gd">sgian dubh</i> and the claymore&mdash;while the
piper blew up his pipes with might and main, its thrilling
tones, for the first time, startling the denizens of the endless
forest, and its echoes resounding through the wild
solitude. Scottish emigrants are admitted upon all
hands to have given its backbone of moral and religious
strength to the Province, and to those brought over from
the Highlands in this vessel is due the honour of being
in the forefront&mdash;the pioneers and vanguard.</p>

<p>But how different was the reality to the expectations of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
these poor creatures, led by the plausibility of the emigration
agent, to expect free estates on their arrival.</p>

<p>The whole scene, as far as the eye could see, was a dense
forest. They crowded on the deck to take stock of their
future home, and their hearts sank within them. They were
landed without the provisions promised, without shelter
of any kind, and were only able by the aid of those few
before them, to erect camps of the rudest and most primitive
description, to shelter their wives and their children
from the elements. Their feelings of disappointment
were most bitter, when they compared the actual facts
with the free farms and the comfort promised them by the
lying emigration agent. Many of them sat down in the
forest and wept bitterly; hardly any provisions were
possessed by the few who were before them, and what
there was among them was soon devoured; making all&mdash;old
and new comers&mdash;almost destitute. It was now too
late to raise any crops that year. To make matters
worse they were sent some three miles into the forest,
so that they could not even take advantage with the same
ease of any fish that might be caught in the harbour.
The whole thing appeared an utter mockery. To unskilled
men the work of clearing seemed hopeless; they
were naturally afraid of the Red Indian and of the wild
beasts of the forest; without roads or paths, they were
frightened to move for fear of getting lost.</p>

<p>Can we wonder that, in such circumstances, they
refused to settle on the company’s lands? though, in consequence,
when provisions arrived, the agents refused to
give them any. Ross and the company quarrelled, and
he ultimately left the newcomers to their fate. The few
of them who had a little money bought what provisions
they could from the agents, while others, less fortunate,
exchanged their clothes for food; but the greater number
had neither money nor clothes to spend or exchange, and
they were all soon left quite destitute. Thus driven to
extremity, they determined to have the provisions retained
by the agents, right or wrong, and two of them
went to claim them. They were positively refused, but
they determined to take what they could by force.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>
They seized the agents, tied them, took their guns from
them, which they hid at a distance; told them that they
must have the food for their families, but that they were
quite willing and determined to pay for them if ever they
were able to do so. They then carefully weighed or
measured the various articles, took account of what each
man received and left, except one, the latter, a powerful
and determined fellow, who was left behind to release the
two agents. This he did, after allowing sufficient time
for his friends to get to a safe distance, when he informed
the prisoners where they could find their guns. Intelligence
was sent to Halifax that the Highlanders were in
rebellion, from whence orders were sent to a Captain
Archibald in Truro, to march his company of militia to
suppress and pacify them; but to his honour be it said,
he, point blank, refused, and sent word that he would do
no such thing. “I know the Highlanders,” he said,
“and if they are fairly treated there will be no trouble
with them.” Finally, orders were given to supply them
with provisions, and Mr. Paterson, one of the agents,
used afterwards to say that the Highlanders who arrived
in poverty, and who had been so badly treated, had paid
him every farthing with which he had trusted
them.</p>

<p>It would be tedious to describe the sufferings which
they afterwards endured. Many of them left. Others,
fathers, mothers, and children, bound themselves away,
as virtual slaves, in other settlements, for mere subsistence.
Those who remained lived in small huts,
covered only with the bark of branches of trees to shelter
them from the bitter winter cold, of the severity of which
they had no previous conception. They had to walk
some eighty miles, through a trackless forest, in deep snow
to Truro, to obtain a few bushels of potatoes, or a little
flour in exchange for their labour, dragging these back all
the way again on their backs, and endless cases of great
suffering from actual want occurred. The remembrance
of these terrible days sank deep into the minds of that
generation, and long after, even to this day, the narration
of the scenes and cruel hardships through which they had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
to pass beguiled, and now beguiles many a winter’s night
as they sit by their now comfortable firesides.</p>

<p>In the following spring they set to work. They cleared
some of the forest, and planted a larger crop. They
learned to hunt the moose, a kind of large deer. They
began to cut timber, and sent a cargo of it from Pictou&mdash;the
first of a trade very profitably and extensively carried
on ever since. The population had, however, grown less
than it was before their arrival; for in this year it
amounted only to 78 persons. One of the modes of laying
up a supply of food for the winter was to dig up a large
quantity of clams or large oysters, pile them in large heaps
on the sea-shore, and then cover them over with sand,
though they were often, in winter, obliged to cut through
ice more than a foot thick to get at them. This will
give a fair idea of the hardships experienced by the
earlier emigrants to these Colonies.</p>

<p>In Prince Edward Island, however, a colony from
Lockerbie, in Dumfriesshire, who came out in 1774,
seemed to have fared even worse. They commenced
operations on the Island with fair prospects of success,
when a plague of locusts, or field mice, broke out, and
consumed everything, even the potatoes in the ground;
and for eighteen months the settlers experienced all the
miseries of a famine, having for several months only what
lobsters or shell-fish they could gather from the sea-shore.
The winter brought them to such a state of weakness
that they were unable to convey food a reasonable distance
even when they had means to buy it.</p>

<p>In this pitiful position they heard that the Pictou
people were making progress that year, and that they had
even some provisions to spare. They sent one of their
number to make enquiry. An American settler, when he
came to Pictou, brought a few slaves with him, and at
this time he had just been to Truro to sell one of them,
and brought home some provisions with the proceeds
of the sale of his negro. The messenger from Prince
Edward Island was putting up at this man’s house. He
was a bit of a humorist, and continued cheerful in spite of
all his troubles. On his return to the Island, the people<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
congregated to hear the news. “What kind of place is
Pictou?” enquired one. “Oh, an awful place. Why, I
was staying with a man who was just eating the last of his
niggers;” and the poor creatures were reduced to such a
point themselves that they actually believed the people
of Pictou to be in such a condition as to oblige them to live
on the flesh of their coloured servants. They were told,
however, that matters were not quite so bad as that, and
fifteen families left for the earlier settlement, where, for a
time, they fared but very little better, but afterwards
became prosperous and happy. A few of their children
and thousands of their grandchildren are now living in
comfort and plenty.</p>

<p>But who can think of these early hardships and cruel
existences without condemning&mdash;even hating&mdash;the
memories of the harsh and heartless Highland and
Scottish lairds, who made existence at home even almost
as miserable for those noble fellows, and who then drove
them in thousands out of their native land, not caring
one iota whether they sank in the Atlantic, or were
starved to death on a strange and uncongenial soil?
Retributive justice demands that posterity should
execrate the memories of the authors of such misery and
horrid cruelty. It may seem uncharitable to write thus
of the dead; but it is impossible to forget their inhuman
conduct, though, no thanks to them&mdash;cruel tigers in
human form&mdash;it has turned out for the better, for the
descendants of those who were banished to what was then
infinitely worse than transportation for the worst crimes.
Such criminals were looked after and cared for; but those
poor fellows, driven out of their homes by the Highland
lairds, and sent across there, were left to starve, helpless,
and uncared for. Their descendants are now a prosperous
and thriving people, and retribution is at hand. The
descendants of the evicted from Sutherland, Ross, Inverness-shires,
and elsewhere, to Canada, are producing
enormous quantities of food, and millions of cattle, to
pour them into this country. What will be the consequence?
The sheep farmer&mdash;the primary and original
cause of the evictions&mdash;will be the first to suffer. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>
price of stock in Scotland must inevitably fall. Rents
must follow, and the joint authors of the original iniquity
will, as a class, then suffer the natural and just penalty of
their past misconduct.</p>

<h3>AN EVICTING AGENT.</h3>

<p>Giving evidence before the Deer Forest Commission of
1892, the late Mr. Æneas R. Macdonell of Camusdarroch,
Arisaig, made an interesting statement. After
mentioning that he was a member of the Scottish Bar, and
had previously been proprietor of Morar, he <span class="lock">proceeded:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>I am able to speak generally as to the population
there used to be in Arisaig in my young days,&mdash;in fact,
the whole tract of country seemed to be populated and to
have numerous houses on all parts of it; but I want to
confine my evidence almost entirely to that portion of the
district which is now under deer forest. It is now
called Rhu-Arisaig, but 100 years ago it was called
Dubh-chamus.</p>

<p>Although I am only seventy-two years of age, I am
able to speak of thirty years beyond that, from 1794.
My grandfather occupied the various places or townships
in Dubh-chamus or Rudha. These were Dubh-chamus,
Rhu, Tirnadrish, Torbae, Rhubrec, Tormor, Rhuemoch,
Claggan, Portavullid, Bal-ur, Ardgaserie, and Achagarrailt.
I am able to speak concerning that period from an
old account-book belonging to my grandfather, to which
I had access a good many years ago, and it was in connection
with a very melancholy occasion in which I was
unfortunately implicated, viz., an emigration from the
estate of Loch Sheil in Moidart. In that account-book
I found thirty-seven names of individuals in the various
families who were paying rent, as sub-tenants to my
grandfather, Archibald Macdonald, Rudha, Arisaig,
who died, I think, in 1828 or 1829. I don’t know where
that account-book now is. At that time it was in the
possession of my uncle, Macdonald of Loch Sheil; and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>
I may as well mention that it was in connection with
Rudha that I came to examine the book.</p>

<p>First I should mention that these people occupied
Rhu as cottars, and they had land for which apparently
they paid no rent, but worked the land, of which Mr.
Macdonald of Rudha cropped a portion. They paid rent
for grazing,&mdash;a small nominal sum, and he himself paid a
very small rent also to the then proprietor, Macdonald
of Clanranald. In fact he, as well as Macdonald of
Borrodale and Macdonald of Glen Alladale, came into
possession of the various lands as being sons of the then
Macdonald of Clanranald. They took these lands with
the population on them, and occupied them.</p>

<p>The rents were paid to the tenants, to these Macdonalds,
at a very small rate, because they themselves
were not highly charged.</p>

<p>It so came to pass that in Lord Cranston’s time my
uncle, Gregor Macdonald, who then occupied Rudha,
had to give a large increase of rent, or be quit of it. Well,
he could not under the old system on which he held
it afford to give more rent. The consequence was that
the farm was taken over him; and the cruel thing was,
that he was obliged to remove all the sub-tenants upon it
who had been there generations before him or his ancestors.
The only thing that he could do was to get his
brother Macdonald of Loch Sheil to take the people over
to Loch Sheil in Moidart. Times grew black, and the
potato famine occurred, and the consequence was that
there was a redundant population, for Moidart had
previously been well inhabitated, and the addition of so
many families from Rudha, Arisaig, quite overwhelmed
them when the potato famine occurred.</p>

<p>I was then puzzled to know how many came from
Rhu, Arisaig, and I got access in that way to the old books
from which I took an extract, and I have here a list
of the names of the various people and the portions of
Rudha that they occupied. In <i>Ardgaserich</i> there were
12, viz., Lachlan Mackinnon, Donald Roy Macinnes,
John Macintyre, John Mackinnon, Patrick Maccormack,
Neil Mackinnon, Ronald Macdonald, Mrs. Macdonald,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>
Donald Macvarish, Duncan Macinnes, John Macdonald,
and Allan Mackinnon. In <i>Torbae</i> there were 4, viz.,
Angus Smith, L. Mackinnon, J. Macdonald, John
Maciasaac. In <i>Dubh-chamus</i>, ten, viz., John Kinnaird,
John Macisaac, Finlay Mackellaig, Archibald Macfarlane,
James Macdonald, Widow Maceachan, Patrick
Grant, Allan Mackinnon, Dugald Macpherson, and
Widow Maclean. In <i>Rudha</i>, 11, viz., Mrs. Donald
Macdonald, Donald Macinnes, Roderick Mackinnon,
John Maccormack, Rory Smith, Angus Bain Macdonald,
Ewan Mackinnon, Peter Macfarlane, Dugald Gillies,
Alexander Macleod, Angus Roy Maceachan. These are
in all 37, and they are evidently of different families.
The rents were given, and the payments made, and
everything in connection with their holdings. The date
of this is 1794.</p>

<p>I was going on to explain that these people, or rather
the descendants of some of them, had to be removed to
Moidart, and in the congested state of the estate it had
to be considered what was best to be done. I was then
a young man. I had just passed at the Bar, and I and
the late respected James Macgregor of Fort William
were appointed trustees to do what was best. We
could see nothing for it,&mdash;it was impossible for the
people to subsist,&mdash;but to assist them to emigrate, and
we were assisted very materially in carrying out the
emigration by the resident Catholic clergyman of that
time, Rev. Ronald Rankine, who indeed followed them.
So many of them went to Australia and a few of them
to America. But never shall I forget until my dying
day,&mdash;it is a source of grief to me that I had anything
whatsoever to do with that emigration, although, at
the same time, God knows I cannot understand how it
could have been averted. Many of the people have
succeeded well and are well-to-do, but if they had remained,
they would have been impoverished themselves,
and they would have impoverished the few that are still
on the estate.</p>

<h3>AN OCTOGENARIAN GAEL.</h3>

<p>In his interesting volume entitled <cite>Reminiscences
and Reflections of an Octogenarian Gael</cite>, Mr. Duncan Campbell,
for over twenty-six years editor of the <cite>Northern
Chronicle</cite>, writes as follows with regard to the Breadalbane
<span class="lock">Evictions:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>As second Marquis, “the son of his father,” contrary
to all prognostications, became, as soon as expiring
leases permitted it, an evicting landlord on a large
scale, and he continued to pursue the policy of joining
farm to farm, and turning out native people, to the
end of his twenty-eight years’ reign. But like the
first spout of the haggis, his first spout of evicting energy
was the hottest. I saw with childish sorrow, impotent
wrath, and awful wonder at man’s inhumanity to man,
the harsh and sweeping Roro and Morenish clearances,
and heard much talk about others which were said to be
as bad if not worse. A comparison of the census returns
for 1831 with those of 1861 will show how the second
Marquis reduced the rural population on his large estates,
while the inhabitants of certain villages were allowed,
or, as at Aberfeldy, encouraged to increase. When
such a loud and long-continued outcry took place about
the Sutherland clearances, it seems at first sight strange
that such small notice was taken by the Press,
authors, and contemporary politicians, of the Breadalbane
evictions, and that the only set attack on the
Marquis should have been left to the vainglorious, blundering,
Dunkeld coal merchant, who added the chief-like
word “Dunalastair” to his designation. One reason&mdash;perchance
the chief one&mdash;for the Marquis’s immunity was
the prominent manner in which he associated himself
with the Nonintrusionists, and his subsequently becoming
an elder and a liberal benefactor of the Free
Church. He had a Presbyterian upbringing, and lived
in accordance with that upbringing. His Free Church
zeal may, therefore, have been as genuine as he wished
it to be believed; but whether simply real or partly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>
simulated, it covered as with a saintly cloak his evictions
proceedings in the eyes of those who would have been his
loud denouncers and scourging critics had he been an
Episcopalian or remained in the Church of Scotland. The
people he evicted, and all of us, young and old, who were
witnesses of the clearances, could not give him much
credit for any good in what seemed to us the purely hard
and commercial spirit of the policy which he carried out
as the owner of a princely Highland property. Such of
the witnesses of the clearances as have lived to see the
present desolation of rural baronies on the Breadalbane
estates can now charitably assume that, had he foreseen
what his land-management policy was to lead up to,
he would, at least, have gone about his thinning-out
business in a more cautious, kindly, and considerate
manner, and not rudely cut, as he did, the precious
ties of hereditary mutual sympathy and reliance which
had long existed between the lords and the native Highland
people of Breadalbane.</p>

<p>It is quite true that in 1834 the population on the
Breadalbane estate needed thinning. The old Marquis
had made a great mistake in dividing holdings which
were too small before, in order to make room for Fencible
soldiers who were not, as eldest sons, heirs to existing
holdings. In twenty years, congestion to an alarming
extent was the natural result of the old man’s mistaken
kindness. There was indeed a good deal of congestion
before that mistake was committed, although migration
and emigration helped to keep it within some limits.
Emigration would have proceeded briskly from 1760
onwards had it not been discouraged by landlords who
found the fighting manhood on their estates a valuable
asset; and when not positively prohibited, emigration
was impeded in various ways by the Government, now
alive to the value of Highlands and Isles as a nursery of
soldiers and sailors. Although discouraged and impeded,
emigration was never wholly stopped, and after Waterloo
Glenlyon, Fortingall, and Breadalbane, Rannoch, Strathearn
and Balquhidder, sent off swarms to Canada, the
United States, and the West Indies. A large swarm<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>
from Breadalbane, Lochearnhead, and Balquhidder
went off to Nova Scotia about 1828, and got Gaelic-speaking
ministers to follow them. In 1829 a great
number of Skyemen from Lord Macdonald’s estate went
to Cape Breton, where Gaelic is the language of the people
and pulpit to this day. The second Marquis of Breadalbane
would have won for himself lasting glory and
honour, and done his race and country valuable service,
if he had chosen to place himself at the head of an emigration
scheme for his surplus people, instead of merely
driving them away, and further trampling on their feelings
by letting the big farms he made by clearing out the
native population to strangers in race, language, and
sympathies. He was rich, childless, and gifted, and he
utterly missed his vocation, or grand chance for gaining
lasting fame among the children of the Gael.</p>

<p>At a later period of my life than this of which I
am now writing, I looked into many kirk session books,
and found that those of the parishes of Kenmore and
Killin indicated a worse state of matters in Breadalbane
than existed in any of the neighbouring parishes. Pauperism
was increasing at a rapid rate, although it was a
notorious fact that rents there were lower than on other
Highland estates. The old Marquis was never a rack-renter.
Other proprietors, when leases terminated, took
more advantage than he did of a chance to raise rents,
and when once raised they strove ever afterwards to
keep them up. But I do not wonder that his son thought
that if things were allowed to go on as he found them on
succeeding to titles and estates, a general bankruptcy
would soon be the result. Without ceasing to regret
and detest his methods, I learned to see the reasonableness
of the second Marquis’s view of the alarming situation.
The population had simply outgrown the means
of decent subsistence from the carefully cultivated
small holdings which were the general rule. Had
it not been for the frugality and self-helpfulness of
the people, the crisis of general poverty would have
come when the inflated war prices ceased, or at least
in the short-crop year of 1826, when the corn raised in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>
Breadalbane, although the hillsides were cultivated as
far up as any cereal crop could be expected to ripen
in the most favourable season, did not supply meal
enough for two-thirds of the people. But the “calanas”
of the women, especially as long as flax-spinning continued
in a flourishing condition, brought in a good deal
of money; and for many years “Calum a Mhuilin”
(Calum of the Mill), otherwise Malcolm Campbell, road
contractor, Killin, led out a host of young men to make
roads in various parts of the country, and these returned
with their earnings to spend the winter at home. These
sources of profit were beginning to dry up when the old
Marquis died.</p>

<p>What came of the dispersed? The least adventurous
or poorest of them slipped away into the nearest
manufacturing town, or mining districts where there was
a demand for unskilled labourers. There some of them
flourished, but not a few of them foundered. The larger
portion of them emigrated to Canada, mainly to the
London district of Ontario, where they cleared forest
farms, cherished their Gaelic language and traditions,
prospered, and hated the Marquis more, perhaps, than he
rightly deserved when things were looked at from his
own hard political-economy point of view.</p>

<p>The following pertinent observations appeared in the
<cite>Dundee Advertiser</cite>, of 10th January, 1914. They are
from the pen of a notable Dundee lawyer, Mr. John
Walker, who has made a special study of the legal aspects
of the Highland <span class="lock">Clearances:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>At the time of Patrick Sellar’s trial the ruthless evictions
carried out by the Stafford family had been so long
in process of execution that no one had the slightest
doubt of the facts of these taking place. The question
tried was not whether they took place, but whether they
were carried out, in one particular instance, in such a way
as to directly cause the death of Donald M’Beath and
Janet M’Kay, two helpless, old, bedridden people. The
trial took place at Inverness. Of the 15 jurors 8 were
landed proprietors, and the rest were mostly either
factors or those interested in factors. The most of the
witnesses for the prosecution were evidently terrified
to say one word against the accused. When Sellar was
arrested, he emitted a declaration which was put in evidence
at the trial, and, to be strictly fair, I shall confine
myself to that. The gist of it is as follows:&mdash;In December,
1813, the crofting lands were advertised to let, and at
the set, where apparently the lands were disposed of to
sheep farmers, a paper was read that the removed
tenants would get allotments “in the lower part of the
county.” “That Lord and Lady Stafford directed the
declarant (Sellar) to offer at the set for any farm he chose
a few pounds beyond the highest offerer; and they
directed Mr. Young on his so offering to prefer him.”
That thus Sellar got possession of the farms of Rhiloisk
and Rossal. That in April, 1814, decrees of removing
were got against all the tenants on these farms. That<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>
the ejections were carried out in June, 1814, and “that
his directions to the officers were that they should lawfully
eject the tenants, and that after ejecting ... they
should remove the roof of every house in Rhimsdale
excepting those occupied by families, wherein sickness
was mentioned to have been.” That he was present at
the first part of the ejections (of the towns of Garvault,
Ravigill, Rhiphail, and Rhiloisk), but after they had
ejected from a few houses and had unroofed these the
tenants of the others “in the neighbourhood yielded
obedience to the warrant, and removed themselves.”
“Interrogated. If the declarant’s orders to the officer
and party were not to throw down the couples and
timber of the different dwelling-houses, barns, kilns, and
sheep cots? Declares that the declarant directed the
officers ... to remove the tenants’ property and effects
from the premises; and thereafter to unroof the huts
to prevent them from retaking possession after the
declarant should leave that part of the county.” Sellar
himself admitted burning only in one case. The proceedings
from a judicial aspect were largely a farce, as
can be judged from the fact that the first evidence adduced
for the defence consisted of written certificates
from three landed proprietors, who did not appear, as to
“Mr. Sellar’s character for humanity,” and that these
certificates, although not evidence, were founded on in
Lord Pitmilly’s charge to the jury. But the important
thing is that Sellar’s declaration implicates Lord and Lady
Stafford as being by their own instructions the direct
instruments of putting this tyrannical under-factor
in the position of rendering homeless some hundreds
of their helpless tenants. The little crofts were made
into large sheep farms, which were advertised to let to the
highest offerer, and the exposure was a farce, because the
Sutherland family had personally arranged that Sellar
was to be allowed to cap the highest offer. One would
require a double-power microscope to see the noble
philanthropy of that transaction! I have extracted the
above summary from the report of the trial, which was
prepared and circulated by Sellar’s own junior counsel.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span></p>

<p>On the other hand, the stories yet told in Sutherland
represent a much harsher state of matters. I personally
have talked with men whose fathers were as young children
turned out on the hillside to see their little cottages
burned to the ground, and I have had pointed out to me
the sites of these same cottages and crofts, where now
there is nothing but miles and miles of dreary waste;
and this did not happen in one or two instances, but in the
whole of Strathnaver, Strathbrora, and many other
places in all parts of the county.</p>

<p>The following interesting letter has been handed to the
Editor by Mr. J. Stewart Bannatyne, solicitor, Glasgow:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="dateline">
“<span class="smcap">Castlebay, Barra.</span><br />

<span class="date">“<i>September 21st, 1912.</i></span></p>

<p>
“Dear Sir,
</p>

<p>“In reply to your letter of the 6th inst., and after consulting
the older inhabitants, I beg to inform you that it
was John Bannatyne who rescued Mrs. J. M’Kinnon, her
sister and another woman, from compulsory emigration,
but it was John Crawford who rescued John M’Lean.
I know the women and M’Lean as well as I know my two
fingers, and heard the whole story from their own lips
different times.</p>

<p>“Both my father and mother were eye-witnesses of
people being chased like wild cattle over the hills, not in
Barra, but in North and South Uists. People can
hardly believe now what took place then, and what my
mother, who died in my arms at the fall of last year, told
me it would be enough to make the devil himself desperate,
if I am not using too strong an expression.</p>

<p>“There is a man still living at Mallaig, Inverness-shire,
named Ewen M’Dugald, who sailed with John
Bannatyne.</p>

<p>“People nowadays are trying to deny that such<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span>
brutalities were carried out by landlords, but they need
not attempt such nonsense. I have no doubt but the
descendants of the perpetrators of those acts are ashamed
of the deeds&mdash;and no wonder.</p>

<h3><a id="NOTE_C"></a>NOTE C. (See page <a href="#Page_234">234</a>.)</h3>

<p>In the <cite>Inverness Courier</cite> for 11th October, 1837, appears
the <span class="lock">following:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>A large body of emigrants sailed from Tobermory,
on the 27th September, for New South Wales. The
vessel was the “Brilliant,” and its size and splendid
fittings were greatly admired. “The people to be conveyed
by this vessel are decidedly the most valuable that
have ever left the shores of Great Britain. They are of
excellent moral character, and, from their knowledge
of agriculture, and management of sheep and cattle,
must prove a most valuable acquisition to a colony like
New South Wales.” The Rev. Mr. Macpherson, of
Tobermory, preached a farewell sermon before the party
sailed. The total number of emigrants was 322, made up
as follows:&mdash;From Ardnamurchan and Strontian, 105;
from Coll and Tiree, 104; from Mull and Iona, 56; from
Morven, 25; and from Dunoon, 28. There were two
teachers and two surgeons. A visitor from New South
Wales presented as many of the party as he met with
letters of introduction, and expressed himself highly
gratified with the prospect of having so valuable an
addition to the colony. A Government agent superintended
the embarkation.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.</p>

<p>Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK</h2>

<p>To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.</p>

<h3>Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works</h3>

<p>1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.</p>

<p>1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.</p>

<p>1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.</p>

<p>1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.</p>

<p>1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:</p>

<p>1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:</p>

<blockquote><p>This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United
  States and most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost
  no restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use
  it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with
  this eBook or online
  at <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>. If you
  are not located in the United States, you'll have to check the laws
  of the country where you are located before using this
  ebook.</p></blockquote>

<p>1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.</p>

<p>1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.</p>

<p>1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.</p>

<p>1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.</p>

<p>1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.</p>

<p>1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.</p>

<p>1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that</p>

<ul>
<li>You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."</li>

<li>You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.</li>

<li>You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.</li>

<li>You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.</li>
</ul>

<p>1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.</p>

<p>1.F.</p>

<p>1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.</p>

<p>1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.</p>

<p>1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.</p>

<p>1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.</p>

<p>1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.</p>

<p>1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.  </p>

<h3>Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.</p>

<p>Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org.</p>

<h3>Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation</h3>

<p>The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.</p>

<p>The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the
mailing address: PO Box 750175, Fairbanks, AK 99775, but its
volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to

<h3>Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.</p>

<p>The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/donate">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.</p>

<p>While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.</p>

<p>International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.</p>

<p>Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate</p>

<h3>Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.</h3>

<p>Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.</p>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.</p>

<p>Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org</p>

<p>This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.</p>
